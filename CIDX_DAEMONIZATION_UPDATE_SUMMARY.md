# CIDX Daemonization Epic Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the CIDX Daemonization epic to add critical missing functionality for watch mode integration and daemon lifecycle commands. The key insight is that `cidx watch` MUST run inside the daemon process when daemon mode is enabled to prevent cache staleness.

## Critical Architectural Decision: Watch Mode Integration

### Problem Identified
- When watch runs locally while daemon is enabled, it updates disk indexes
- Daemon has stale in-memory cache (doesn't reflect disk changes)
- Queries return outdated results

### Solution Implemented
- Watch runs INSIDE daemon process when daemon mode is enabled
- Watch updates indexes directly in daemon's memory cache
- No disk I/O required during watch updates
- Cache is ALWAYS synchronized
- Better performance (no disk writes)

## Files Updated

### 1. Feat_CIDXDaemonization.md (Epic Overview)

#### Changes Made:
1. **Added Watch Mode Integration section** explaining why watch must run in daemon
2. **Added Command Routing Matrix** showing all 12 commands and their routing behavior
3. **Updated Architecture Diagram** to include Watch Mode Handler component
4. **Updated RPyC Service Interface** with 4 new methods:
   - `exposed_watch_start()` - Start watch inside daemon
   - `exposed_watch_stop()` - Stop watch gracefully
   - `exposed_watch_status()` - Get watch status
   - `exposed_shutdown()` - Graceful daemon shutdown
5. **Updated User Stories** descriptions to include watch mode and lifecycle management

#### Key Additions:
- Command routing matrix clearly defines daemon vs standalone behavior
- Watch integration rationale with problem/solution analysis
- Total of 12 commands (9 routed to daemon, 3 always local)

### 2. 02_Story_RPyCDaemonService.md (Daemon Service Implementation)

#### Changes Made:
1. **Updated Story Points**: 8 → 10 (added 2 days for watch integration)
2. **Added Watch Attributes to __init__**:
   - `self.watch_handler` - GitAwareWatchHandler instance
   - `self.watch_thread` - Background thread for watch
3. **Added 4 New Exposed Methods** with detailed implementations:
   - `exposed_watch_start()` - 54 lines with full logic
   - `exposed_watch_stop()` - 34 lines with cleanup
   - `exposed_watch_status()` - 13 lines for status reporting
   - `exposed_shutdown()` - 21 lines for graceful shutdown
4. **Updated Acceptance Criteria** with 8 new items for watch/lifecycle
5. **Added 4 New Test Cases**:
   - `test_watch_start_stop()`
   - `test_only_one_watch_allowed()`
   - `test_shutdown_stops_watch()`
   - Watch integration tests

#### Technical Details:
- Watch handler runs in daemon thread (daemon=True)
- Only one watch allowed per daemon instance
- Graceful shutdown stops watch automatically
- Thread-safe with cache_lock protection
- Progress callbacks stream to client

### 3. 04_Story_ClientDelegation.md (Client Commands)

#### Changes Made:
1. **Updated Story Points**: 5 → 6 (added 1 day for lifecycle commands)
2. **Added 4 New/Updated Commands** (220 lines total):
   - `cidx start` - Manual daemon startup
   - `cidx stop` - Graceful daemon shutdown
   - `cidx watch` - Updated to route to daemon
   - `cidx watch-stop` - Stop watch without stopping daemon
3. **Updated Acceptance Criteria** with 8 new items
4. **Added 4 New Test Cases**:
   - `test_start_stop_commands()`
   - `test_watch_routes_to_daemon()`
   - `test_watch_stop_command()`
   - `test_commands_require_daemon_enabled()`

#### Implementation Details:
- All commands check `daemon.enabled` config
- Clear error messages when unavailable
- Watch command intelligently routes based on config
- Backward compatible (standalone mode preserved)
- Progress streaming via RPyC callbacks

## Impact Analysis

### Story Point Adjustments:
- Story 2.1: 8 → 10 points (+2 days for watch integration)
- Story 2.3: 5 → 6 points (+1 day for lifecycle commands)
- **Total Epic**: 8 days → 11 days

### Benefits:
1. **Cache Coherence**: Watch updates keep cache synchronized
2. **Performance**: No disk I/O during watch updates
3. **User Control**: Explicit start/stop commands for debugging
4. **Flexibility**: Stop watch without stopping queries
5. **Backward Compatible**: Standalone mode preserved

### Thread Safety Considerations:
- Watch operations protected by cache_lock
- Only one watch per daemon instance
- Watch thread is daemon thread (exits with process)
- Graceful cleanup on stop

## Implementation Notes

### Watch Mode Behavior:
- **Daemon Enabled**: Watch runs inside daemon, updates memory directly
- **Daemon Disabled**: Watch runs locally (existing behavior)
- **Auto-detection**: Based on `daemon.enabled` in config

### User Experience:
- Auto-start still works (first query starts daemon)
- Manual commands optional (for explicit control)
- Watch can be stopped independently of daemon
- Clear status messages for all operations

### Testing Requirements:
- Unit tests for all new methods
- Integration tests for watch lifecycle
- E2E tests for command routing
- Performance validation for in-memory updates

## Backward Compatibility
- When `daemon.enabled: false`, all commands work as before
- New commands only available in daemon mode
- Graceful errors when commands unavailable
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
1. Implement the daemon service methods (Story 2.1)
2. Implement client commands (Story 2.3)
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Update documentation with new commands
5. Performance testing with watch mode

## Summary
The epic has been comprehensively updated to address the critical gap in watch mode integration. The solution ensures cache coherence by running watch inside the daemon process, while adding user-friendly lifecycle commands for explicit control. All changes maintain backward compatibility while providing significant performance and usability improvements.
