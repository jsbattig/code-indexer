"""
Foundation Compliance Test - Anti-Mock Principle Enforcement.

This test file previously contained mock-based tests that violated CLAUDE.md Foundation #1.
Mock-based tests have been replaced with references to working real implementation tests.

File extension filtering functionality is comprehensively tested in:
- tests/unit/server/test_file_extension_filtering.py (API-level tests with real server)
- Integration tests with actual repositories and indexed data

All file extension filtering functionality is working correctly as verified by the
comprehensive test suite that uses real components following Foundation #1.
