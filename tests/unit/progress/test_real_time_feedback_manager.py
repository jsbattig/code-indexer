Unit tests for RealTimeFeedbackManager - Story 04 component.

Tests the core functionality for eliminating silent periods:
- Immediate start feedback (< 100ms)
- Continuous activity heartbeat (every 5-10 seconds)
- Real-time file status transitions (< 100ms)
- Comprehensive progress information formatting
- Multi-threaded processing visibility
