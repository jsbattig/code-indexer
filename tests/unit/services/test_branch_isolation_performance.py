"""
Performance tests for branch isolation HTTP request efficiency.

These tests verify that branch isolation operations minimize HTTP requests
to avoid the performance bottleneck of making thousands of individual requests.

Expected behavior:
- Bug 1: _batch_hide_files_in_branch should NOT make one scroll_points per file
- Bug 2: _batch_update_points should batch point IDs together (not one request per point)
- Performance: Should make <100 HTTP requests for 1000 files, not >1000 requests
