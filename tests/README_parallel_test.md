# Parallel Processing Performance Test

## Overview

`test_parallel_voyage_performance.py` is a comprehensive test that verifies VoyageAI parallel processing performance with the `VectorCalculationManager`.

## What It Tests

This test exercises the queue-based parallel embedding generation layer specifically against VoyageAI with:

- **1 thread** vs **4 threads** vs **8 threads**
- Same set of **15 realistic code chunks** for all configurations
- Measures **embeddings per second (emb/s)** for each configuration
- **Fails if velocity doesn't improve** with more threads

## Requirements

- VoyageAI API key in environment (`VOYAGE_API_KEY`)
- VoyageAI service available and responsive

## Running the Test

```bash
# Run with pytest
pytest tests/test_parallel_voyage_performance.py -v

# Run directly
python tests/test_parallel_voyage_performance.py
```

## Expected Results

The test validates:

1. **4 threads â‰¥ 1.5x faster than 1 thread**
2. **8 threads â‰¥ 1.2x faster than 4 threads**  
3. **All configurations â‰¥ 1.0 emb/s absolute performance**

## Purpose

This test ensures that:
- Parallel processing actually works (no queue bottlenecks)
- Thread scaling provides real performance benefits
- VoyageAI API handles concurrent requests properly
- No defects introduced in the parallel processing pipeline
