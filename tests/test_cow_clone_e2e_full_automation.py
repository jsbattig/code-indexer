End-to-End Test for Copy-on-Write Clone Workflow with Real Services

This test verifies the complete CoW clone workflow using real services:
- Qdrant for vector storage
- File system operations
- Docker container management
- Migration middleware

WARNING: This test is designed for full-automation.sh ONLY
- Uses real Qdrant services
- Requires CoW filesystem (btrfs, ZFS, etc.)
- Takes significant time to complete
- NOT included in ci-github.sh

Test Scenario:
1. Create test project with local storage
2. Index files and verify content
3. Start watch mode and make changes
4. Perform safe CoW clone workflow
5. Verify both projects work independently
6. Confirm local collections are used
7. Test project isolation
