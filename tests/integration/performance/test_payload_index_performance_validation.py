Payload Index Performance Validation Tests

This module provides unique performance testing for payload index operations
that is different from the comprehensive E2E validation.

Focus areas:
- Performance benchmarks for payload index operations
- Throughput validation under different load conditions
- Memory usage and efficiency metrics
- Latency measurements for index operations
