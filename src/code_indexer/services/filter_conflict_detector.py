"""
Filter conflict detection service for query filters.

This service detects contradictory or problematic filter combinations
and provides warnings to users before executing queries.

Design principles:
- Detect exact conflicts (include AND exclude same thing)
- Warn about potential issues (excluding too much)
- Provide clear, actionable messages
- Fast performance (<5ms)
