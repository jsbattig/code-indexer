"""Command validation for proxy mode.

This module validates that only supported commands execute in proxy mode
and provides clear error messages for unsupported commands.

Supported proxy commands (hardcoded as per Story 2.4):
- query: Search across all repositories
- status: Check status of all repositories
- start: Start services in all repositories (sequential)
- stop: Stop services in all repositories (sequential)
- uninstall: Uninstall services from all repositories (sequential)
- fix-config: Fix configuration in all repositories
- watch: Watch for changes in all repositories

All other commands (init, index, reconcile, etc.) are not supported in proxy mode.
