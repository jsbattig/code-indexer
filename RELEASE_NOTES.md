# AFTER (FIXED): Check filesystem existence before skipping
if self.is_git_aware():
    file_path = self.config.codebase_dir / indexed_file_str
    if not file_path.exists():
        # File genuinely deleted - safe to remove from database
        deleted_files.append(indexed_file_str)
    # Branch isolation handles visibility for existing files
