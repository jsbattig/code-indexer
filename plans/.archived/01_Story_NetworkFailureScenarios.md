# Story 8.1: Network Failure Scenarios

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate network failure handling and resilience testing for remote CIDX operations through systematic manual testing procedures.

[Conversation Reference: "Network failure scenarios"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Developer
**I want to** understand how CIDX handles network failures and connectivity issues
**So that** I can work effectively even with intermittent network connectivity

[Conversation Reference: "Each test story specifies exact python -m code_indexer.cli commands to execute"]

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 8.1.1: Complete Network Disconnection During Query
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Disconnect network during execution
python -m code_indexer.cli query "authentication function" --limit 10
```

**Expected Results:**
- Query detects network failure before timeout
- Clear error message about network connectivity loss
- Suggestion to check network connection and retry
- Graceful failure without crashes or data corruption

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Network failure detected gracefully with clear error message
- ‚ùå FAIL: Command hangs, crashes, or provides cryptic error

[Conversation Reference: "Clear pass/fail criteria for manual verification"]

### Test 8.1.2: Intermittent Network Connectivity
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Simulate intermittent connectivity (on/off/on during command)
python -m code_indexer.cli list-repositories
```

**Expected Results:**
- Command attempts automatic retry on network recovery
- Clear indication of retry attempts and network status
- Eventual success when connectivity stabilizes
- Informative progress messages during retry process

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Automatic retry succeeds with clear progress indication
- ‚ùå FAIL: No retry attempts or poor network recovery handling

### Test 8.1.3: Server Unavailable Scenarios
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test with server stopped/unreachable
python -m code_indexer.cli query "database connection" --limit 5
```

**Expected Results:**
- Server unavailability detected within reasonable timeout (< 30 seconds)
- Clear distinction between network issues and server problems
- Helpful suggestions for resolving server connectivity
- No indefinite hanging or resource consumption

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Server unavailability handled with appropriate timeout and messages
- ‚ùå FAIL: Indefinite hanging or poor server error detection

### Test 8.1.4: DNS Resolution Failures
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test with DNS issues (invalid hostname or DNS server problems)
python -m code_indexer.cli init --remote https://invalid-server-name.example --username test --password test
```

**Expected Results:**
- DNS resolution failure detected quickly
- Clear error message about hostname resolution problems
- Suggestions to verify server URL and DNS configuration
- No extended delays due to DNS timeouts

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: DNS failures handled quickly with clear error messages
- ‚ùå FAIL: Excessive DNS timeout delays or unclear error reporting

### Test 8.1.5: Partial Network Failures (Slow Connection)
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test with severely limited bandwidth or high latency
python -m code_indexer.cli query "error handling patterns" --timing
```

**Expected Results:**
- Query completes despite slow network conditions
- Timing information shows extended but reasonable completion time
- Progress indication during slow network operations
- Timeout handling appropriate for slow but functional connections

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Slow network handled with appropriate timeouts and progress feedback
- ‚ùå FAIL: Premature timeouts or no progress indication during slow operations

### Test 8.1.6: Network Recovery After Failure
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Disconnect network, run command (should fail), reconnect, run again
python -m code_indexer.cli check-staleness
# (Disconnect network)
# (Wait for failure)
# (Reconnect network)
python -m code_indexer.cli check-staleness
```

**Expected Results:**
- First command fails gracefully with network error
- Network recovery detected on subsequent command
- Second command succeeds after network restoration
- No residual issues from previous network failures

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Network recovery handled cleanly, subsequent operations succeed
- ‚ùå FAIL: Persistent errors after network recovery or connection state corruption

### Test 8.1.7: Concurrent Network Failure Impact
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Run multiple commands simultaneously during network failure
python -m code_indexer.cli query "function definition" &
python -m code_indexer.cli list-branches &
python -m code_indexer.cli staleness-report &
wait
```

**Expected Results:**
- All concurrent commands handle network failure independently
- No command interferes with others' error handling
- Consistent error reporting across all failed operations
- No resource leaks or hanging processes

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Concurrent operations handle network failures independently
- ‚ùå FAIL: Commands interfere with each other or cause resource issues

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Failure Detection Time**: Network issues detected within 30 seconds
- **Error Message Quality**: Clear, actionable guidance for all network failures
- **Recovery Success Rate**: 100% success rate after network restoration
- **Resource Management**: No hanging processes or resource leaks during failures

- [ ] Concurrent operations handle network failures independently
- [ ] All network error scenarios provide actionable user guidance

[Conversation Reference: "Clear acceptance criteria for manual assessment"]

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- CIDX remote mode configured and normally functional
- Ability to control network connectivity (disconnect/reconnect)
- Access to firewall or network simulation tools
- Multiple concurrent command execution capability

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Verify normal network connectivity and CIDX functionality baseline
2. Prepare network control mechanisms (disconnect, slow bandwidth, DNS blocking)
3. Have multiple terminal sessions for concurrent testing
4. Ensure server can be stopped/started for server unavailability testing

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. Verify no hanging processes remain after network failures
2. Confirm configuration state intact after network recovery
3. Test that normal operations resume cleanly after recovery
4. Check system resources not consumed by failed network operations
