# Feature 5: Repository Synchronization

## 🎯 **Feature Intent**

Test repository state synchronization functionality to ensure reliable sync operations between local and remote repositories with proper progress reporting.

[Conversation Reference: "05_Feat_RepositorySynchronization: Repository state synchronization"]

## 📋 **Feature Summary**

This feature validates CIDX's repository synchronization capabilities, ensuring that local repositories can be synchronized with remote server state including git operations and semantic index updates. Testing focuses on sync command execution, progress reporting, and synchronization accuracy.

## 🔧 **Implementation Stories**

### Story 5.1: Manual Sync Operations Testing
**Priority**: Medium - enhanced capability validation
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- python -m code_indexer.cli sync command executes successfully
- Git synchronization works correctly (pull, merge, rebase)
- Semantic index updates after sync operations
- Progress reporting shows sync status accurately

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Sync Performance**: Repository sync completes within reasonable time limits
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time progress reporting during sync operations
- **Sync Accuracy**: Local repository state matches remote after sync
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery guidance

## 🎯 **Story Implementation Checkboxes**

- [ ] **Story 5.1**: Manual Sync Operations Testing
  - [ ] Test basic python -m code_indexer.cli sync command execution
  - [ ] Test sync with various merge strategies
  - [ ] Test sync progress reporting functionality
  - [ ] Test sync error handling and recovery

## 🏗️ **Dependencies**

### Prerequisites
- Feature 4 (Semantic Search) must be completed
- Git repositories with remote origins configured
- Write permissions to repository directories

### Blocks
- Advanced sync scenarios depend on basic sync functionality
- Performance testing requires working synchronization
- Multi-user testing requires sync operations
