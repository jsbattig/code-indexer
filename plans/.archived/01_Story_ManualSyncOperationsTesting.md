# Story 5.1: Manual Sync Operations Testing

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate repository synchronization functionality to ensure reliable sync operations between local and remote repositories with proper progress reporting.

[Conversation Reference: "Manual sync operations"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Developer
**I want to** synchronize my local repository with remote server state
**So that** my code and semantic index stay current with team changes

[Conversation Reference: "Repository state synchronization"]

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 5.1.1: Basic Repository Sync
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli sync
```

**Expected Results:**
- Sync operation starts successfully
- Git pull/fetch operations execute correctly
- Semantic index updates after git changes
- Progress reporting shows sync phases clearly

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Sync completes successfully with updated repository state
- ‚ùå FAIL: Sync fails or repository state inconsistent

[Conversation Reference: "python -m code_indexer.cli sync command executes successfully"]

### Test 5.1.2: Full Repository Re-indexing
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli sync --full-reindex
```

**Expected Results:**
- Forces complete semantic re-indexing instead of incremental
- All repository files processed regardless of change status
- Progress shows full re-indexing operation
- Repository index completely refreshed

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Complete re-indexing performed successfully
- ‚ùå FAIL: Incremental sync performed or indexing issues

### Test 5.1.3: Sync Without Git Pull
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli sync --no-pull
```

**Expected Results:**
- Skips git pull operations entirely
- Only performs indexing on current repository state
- No network git operations attempted
- Local repository content indexed as-is

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Indexing performed without git operations
- ‚ùå FAIL: Git pull attempted or sync fails

### Test 5.1.4: Dry Run Preview
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli sync --dry-run
```

**Expected Results:**
- Shows what would be synced without execution
- Lists repositories and operations planned
- No actual sync operations performed
- Clear preview of intended actions

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Clear preview without actual execution
- ‚ùå FAIL: Operations executed or unclear preview

### Test 5.1.5: Bulk Repository Sync
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli sync --all
```

**Expected Results:**
- Syncs all activated repositories for the user
- Processes multiple repositories sequentially
- Reports individual repository sync results
- Handles failures in individual repositories gracefully

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: All repositories processed with individual status reporting
- ‚ùå FAIL: Bulk sync fails or incomplete repository coverage

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Sync Reliability**: >95% success rate for standard sync operations
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time progress updates every 5% completion
- **Performance**: Repository sync completes within 2 minutes for typical repositories
- **State Consistency**: Local repository matches remote state after sync

[Conversation Reference: "Real-time progress reporting during sync operations"]

## üéØ **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Basic sync operations complete successfully with proper git updates
- [ ] Merge strategies are applied correctly during synchronization
- [ ] Full re-sync operations work for complete repository refresh
- [ ] Progress reporting provides clear visibility into sync phases
- [ ] Error conditions during sync are handled gracefully
- [ ] Final repository state is consistent after successful sync

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Feature 4 (Semantic Search) testing
- Repository with remote origin configured
- Write permissions to repository directories
- Server-side repository with updates available for testing

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Ensure repository has remote origin with available updates
2. Create local changes to test merge strategy handling
3. Verify write permissions for git and index operations
4. Prepare for progress monitoring during sync operations

**Sync Testing Scenarios:**
- Clean repository (no local changes)
- Repository with uncommitted local changes
- Repository with committed but unpushed changes
- Repository requiring merge conflict resolution

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. Repository git state matches expected outcome
2. Semantic index updated to reflect repository changes
3. No corruption in git or index data
4. Progress reporting was accurate throughout sync

**Common Issues:**
- Merge conflicts requiring manual resolution
- Network interruptions during sync operations
- Permission issues with git or index files
- Large repositories requiring extended sync times
