# User Story: Secure Token Lifecycle

## 📋 **User Story**

As a **CIDX developer**, I want **JWT token management fully contained within API client abstraction**, so that **business logic never handles authentication concerns and token security is centralized**.

## 🎯 **Business Value**

Ensures secure and maintainable token handling by centralizing all JWT operations within API client layer. Eliminates security vulnerabilities from token mishandling in business logic.

## 📝 **Acceptance Criteria**

### Given: API Client Token Management
**When** I use any remote API operation  
**Then** JWT token acquisition and refresh happens transparently within API client  
**And** business logic never receives or handles raw JWT tokens  
**And** token validation and expiration checking handled automatically  
**And** concurrent operations share token state safely  

### Given: Automatic Token Refresh
**When** JWT tokens approach expiration during operations  
**Then** API client automatically refreshes tokens before they expire  
**And** refresh happens transparently without interrupting operations  
**And** refresh failures trigger re-authentication automatically  
**And** token refresh optimized to minimize authentication calls  

## 📊 **Definition of Done**

- ✅ JWT token management centralized in CIDXRemoteAPIClient
- ✅ Automatic token refresh before expiration
- ✅ Thread-safe token operations for concurrent requests
- ✅ Business logic isolation from authentication concerns
- ✅ Secure memory handling for token data
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with token expiration scenarios
- ✅ Integration with all specialized API clients
- ✅ Performance optimization to minimize authentication overhead
