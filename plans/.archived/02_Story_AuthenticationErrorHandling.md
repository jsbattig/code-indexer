# Story 8.2: Authentication Error Handling

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate authentication error handling and credential management through systematic manual testing procedures.

[Conversation Reference: "Authentication error handling"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Developer
**I want to** understand how CIDX handles authentication failures and credential issues
**So that** I can troubleshoot and resolve authentication problems effectively

[Conversation Reference: "Each test story specifies exact python -m code_indexer.cli commands to execute"]

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 8.2.1: Invalid Credentials on Initial Setup
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli init --remote https://cidx-server.example.com --username invaliduser --password wrongpass
```

**Expected Results:**
- Authentication failure detected during initialization
- Clear error message about invalid username/password
- No partial configuration files created
- Suggestions for verifying credentials and trying again

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Authentication failure handled cleanly with no partial setup
- ‚ùå FAIL: Poor error message or partial configuration created

[Conversation Reference: "Clear pass/fail criteria for manual verification"]

### Test 8.2.2: Expired Authentication Token During Query
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Let authentication token expire, then run query
python -m code_indexer.cli query "authentication patterns" --limit 5
```

**Expected Results:**
- Expired token detected before query execution
- Automatic token refresh attempted if refresh token valid
- Clear prompt for re-authentication if refresh fails
- Query completes after successful re-authentication

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Token expiration handled with automatic refresh or clear re-auth prompt
- ‚ùå FAIL: Query fails without clear authentication guidance

### Test 8.2.3: Corrupted Credential Storage
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Manually corrupt .remote-config file, then run command
python -m code_indexer.cli list-repositories
```

**Expected Results:**
- Corrupted credentials detected on command execution
- Clear error message about credential file corruption
- Suggestion to re-initialize remote configuration
- No attempts to use corrupted authentication data

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Credential corruption detected with clear re-initialization guidance
- ‚ùå FAIL: Undefined behavior or cryptic errors from corrupted credentials

### Test 8.2.4: Server-Side Authentication Changes
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test after server-side password change or account deactivation
python -m code_indexer.cli query "database operations" --limit 3
```

**Expected Results:**
- Server authentication rejection detected
- Clear error message about authentication failure
- Distinction between network issues and authentication problems
- Guidance to check account status and update credentials

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Server-side auth changes detected with clear error explanation
- ‚ùå FAIL: Authentication failures confused with network or other errors

### Test 8.2.5: Multiple Authentication Failure Attempts
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Repeatedly attempt operations with invalid credentials
python -m code_indexer.cli query "test query" --limit 1
python -m code_indexer.cli query "another query" --limit 1
python -m code_indexer.cli list-branches
```

**Expected Results:**
- Each authentication failure handled consistently
- No account lockout or excessive retry attempts
- Clear indication of persistent authentication problems
- Guidance to resolve authentication before continuing

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Multiple failures handled consistently with clear persistent problem indication
- ‚ùå FAIL: Inconsistent error handling or excessive server requests

### Test 8.2.6: Re-authentication Flow
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# After authentication failure, attempt to fix credentials
python -m code_indexer.cli reauth --username validuser --password validpass
```

**Expected Results:**
- Re-authentication command available and functional
- Successful credential update after providing valid credentials
- Confirmation of successful authentication
- Subsequent operations work with new credentials

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Re-authentication flow works smoothly with credential updates
- ‚ùå FAIL: Re-authentication unavailable or doesn't update credentials properly

### Test 8.2.7: Authentication Status Checking
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli auth-status
```

**Expected Results:**
- Display current authentication status (authenticated/expired/invalid)
- Show username and server for current authentication
- Indicate token expiration time if applicable
- Provide guidance on authentication actions needed

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Authentication status comprehensive and accurate
- ‚ùå FAIL: Status missing, inaccurate, or provides insufficient information

### Test 8.2.8: Concurrent Authentication Failures
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Run multiple commands simultaneously with invalid authentication
python -m code_indexer.cli query "concurrent test 1" &
python -m code_indexer.cli query "concurrent test 2" &
python -m code_indexer.cli list-repositories &
wait
```

**Expected Results:**
- All concurrent commands handle authentication failure independently
- Consistent authentication error messages across all operations
- No interference between concurrent authentication attempts
- Clean failure without resource consumption

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Concurrent authentication failures handled consistently and cleanly
- ‚ùå FAIL: Inconsistent errors or resource issues with concurrent auth failures

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Error Clarity**: 100% clear distinction between authentication and other errors
- **Recovery Success**: Successful re-authentication after credential updates
- **Security**: No credential exposure in error messages or logs
- **User Experience**: Clear guidance for resolving authentication problems

[Conversation Reference: "Clear acceptance criteria for manual assessment"]

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- CIDX server with authentication enabled
- Valid and invalid test credentials available
- Ability to modify/corrupt credential files
- Server access for authentication configuration changes

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Ensure working authentication baseline for comparison
2. Prepare valid and invalid credential combinations
3. Have ability to corrupt credential files safely
4. Coordinate server-side authentication changes if possible

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. Verify no credential exposure in logs or error messages
2. Confirm credential files properly secured after operations
3. Test that authentication recovery restores full functionality
4. Validate no persistent authentication state corruption
