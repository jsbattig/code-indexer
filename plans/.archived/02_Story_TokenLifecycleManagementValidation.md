# Story 2.2: Token Lifecycle Management Validation

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate JWT token lifecycle including automatic refresh, expiration handling, and secure token management throughout the session.

[Conversation Reference: "Token lifecycle management validation"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Developer
**I want to** have seamless token management during remote sessions
**So that** I can work continuously without authentication interruptions

[Conversation Reference: "Automatic refresh prevents authentication interruptions"]

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 2.2.1: Remote Status and Token Information
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli status
```

**Expected Results:**
- Remote mode status displayed
- Authentication status confirmed
- Current session information shown
- Server connectivity status confirmed

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Remote status and authentication information displayed
- ‚ùå FAIL: Missing or incorrect remote mode status

### Test 2.2.2: Automatic Token Refresh
**Setup:** Wait until token is within refresh window (typically 5 minutes before expiration)
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli query "test pattern" --verbose
```

**Expected Results:**
- Token refresh occurs automatically before query execution
- New token acquired seamlessly
- Query executes with refreshed token
- Verbose output shows refresh activity

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Seamless token refresh without user intervention
- ‚ùå FAIL: Token expiration causes query failure

### Test 2.2.3: Expired Token Handling
**Setup:** Force token expiration or wait for natural expiration
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli query "test pattern"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Expired token detected
- Automatic re-authentication attempted
- New token acquired successfully
- Query completes after re-authentication

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Graceful handling of expired tokens
- ‚ùå FAIL: Hard failure on token expiration

### Test 2.2.4: Token Memory Management
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage during token operations
python -m code_indexer.cli login --username testuser --password testpass
# Execute multiple queries
python -m code_indexer.cli query "test1" && python -m code_indexer.cli query "test2" && python -m code_indexer.cli query "test3"
python -m code_indexer.cli logout
```

**Expected Results:**
- Token stored securely in memory during session
- No token data written to disk unnecessarily
- Token cleared from memory on logout
- No memory leaks during token operations

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Secure memory management throughout lifecycle
- ‚ùå FAIL: Token leakage or memory issues

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Refresh Accuracy**: Token refresh occurs within optimal time window
- **Session Continuity**: No authentication interruptions during normal operation
- **Memory Security**: Token data properly protected in memory
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of token-related errors

[Conversation Reference: "JWT token management with automatic refresh"]

## üéØ **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Token expiration information is accurate and accessible
- [ ] Automatic token refresh prevents session interruptions
- [ ] Expired tokens are handled gracefully with re-authentication
- [ ] Token data is managed securely in memory without disk exposure
- [ ] Token lifecycle events are logged appropriately for debugging
- [ ] Error conditions during token operations provide clear guidance

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Story 2.1 (Login/Logout Flow Testing)
- Active authentication session with valid token
- Server configured for JWT token refresh
- Access to verbose logging for token operations

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Start with fresh authentication session
2. Note initial token expiration time
3. Prepare to monitor memory usage (using tools like `top` or `htop`)
4. Set up verbose logging to track token operations

**Timing Considerations:**
- Token refresh testing may require waiting for actual time to pass
- Consider server-side configuration for token lifetimes
- Plan for potential long-running tests (up to token expiration period)

**Security Monitoring:**
1. Monitor for token data in disk files
2. Check memory dumps for token exposure
3. Verify token transmission uses secure channels
4. Confirm proper cleanup after operations

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. Token lifecycle operates smoothly without user intervention
2. No token data exposed in insecure locations
3. Memory usage remains stable during token operations
4. Error conditions handled gracefully
