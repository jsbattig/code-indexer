# Story: Complete File Chunking Manager

## ðŸ“– User Story

As a **system architect**, I want **a complete FileChunkingManager that handles parallel file processing with vector integration and Qdrant writing** so that **the system can process files in parallel while maintaining file atomicity and providing immediate feedback**.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

### Given complete FileChunkingManager implementation

#### Scenario: Complete Functional Implementation
- [ ] **Given** FileChunkingManager class with complete implementation  
- [ ] **When** initialized with vector_manager, chunker, and thread_count
- [ ] **Then** creates ThreadPoolExecutor with (thread_count + 2) workers per user specs
- [ ] **And** provides submit_file_for_processing() method that returns Future
- [ ] **And** handles complete file lifecycle: chunk â†’ vector â†’ wait â†’ write to Qdrant
- [ ] **And** maintains file atomicity within worker threads
- [ ] **And** ADDRESSES user problem: "not efficient for very small files" via parallel processing
- [ ] **And** ADDRESSES user problem: "no feedback when chunking files" via immediate callbacks

#### Scenario: Worker Thread Complete File Processing
- [ ] **Given** file submitted to FileChunkingManager
- [ ] **When** worker thread processes file using _process_file_complete_lifecycle()
- [ ] **Then** MOVE chunking logic from main thread (line 404) to worker thread
- [ ] **And** chunks = self.fixed_size_chunker.chunk_file(file_path) executes in worker
- [ ] **And** ALL chunks submitted to existing VectorCalculationManager (unchanged)
- [ ] **And** worker waits for ALL chunk vectors: future.result() for each chunk
- [ ] **And** MOVE _create_qdrant_point() calls from main thread to worker thread  
- [ ] **And** MOVE qdrant_client.upsert_points_atomic() from main thread to worker thread
- [ ] **And** FileProcessingResult returned with success/failure status

#### Scenario: Immediate Queuing Feedback
- [ ] **Given** file submitted for processing
- [ ] **When** submit_file_for_processing() is called
- [ ] **Then** immediate progress callback: "ðŸ“¥ Queued for processing" 
- [ ] **And** feedback appears before method returns
- [ ] **And** user sees immediate acknowledgment of file submission
- [ ] **And** no silent periods during file queuing

#### Scenario: Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] **Given** file processing encountering errors
- [ ] **When** chunking, vector processing, or Qdrant writing fails
- [ ] **Then** errors logged with specific file context
- [ ] **And** FileProcessingResult indicates failure with error details
- [ ] **And** other files continue processing (error isolation)
- [ ] **And** thread pool remains stable (no thread crashes)

#### Scenario: Integration with Existing System
- [ ] **Given** FileChunkingManager integrated with HighThroughputProcessor
- [ ] **When** replacing sequential file processing loop
- [ ] **Then** existing VectorCalculationManager used without changes
- [ ] **And** existing progress callback system preserved
- [ ] **And** existing Qdrant writing logic reused
- [ ] **And** file atomicity patterns maintained

### Pseudocode Algorithm

```
Class FileChunkingManager:
    Initialize(vector_manager, chunker, thread_count):
        self.vector_manager = vector_manager
        self.chunker = chunker  
        self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=thread_count + 2)
        
    submit_file_for_processing(file_path, metadata, progress_callback):
        // Immediate queuing feedback
        If progress_callback:
            progress_callback(0, 0, file_path, info="ðŸ“¥ Queued for processing")
            
        // Submit to worker thread (immediate return)
        Return self.executor.submit(
            self._process_file_complete_lifecycle,
            file_path, metadata, progress_callback
        )
        
    _process_file_complete_lifecycle(file_path, metadata, progress_callback):
        Try:
            // Phase 1: Chunk the file
            chunks = self.chunker.chunk_file(file_path)
            If not chunks:
                Return FileProcessingResult(success=False, message="No chunks generated")
                
            // Phase 2: Submit ALL chunks to vector processing
            chunk_futures = []
            For each chunk in chunks:
                future = self.vector_manager.submit_chunk(chunk["text"], metadata)
                chunk_futures.append(future)
                
            // Phase 3: Wait for ALL chunk vectors to complete
            file_points = []
            For each future in chunk_futures:
                vector_result = future.result(timeout=300)
                If not vector_result.error:
                    qdrant_point = create_qdrant_point(chunk, vector_result.embedding)
                    file_points.append(qdrant_point)
                    
            // Phase 4: Write complete file atomically
            If file_points:
                success = qdrant_client.upsert_points_atomic(file_points)
                If not success:
                    Return FileProcessingResult(success=False, error="Qdrant write failed")
                    
            Return FileProcessingResult(success=True, chunks_processed=len(file_points))
            
        Catch Exception as e:
            Return FileProcessingResult(success=False, error=str(e))

@dataclass
Class FileProcessingResult:
    success: bool
    file_path: str  
    chunks_processed: int
    processing_time: float
    error: Optional[str] = None
