# Feature 0: Server Setup

## üéØ **Feature Intent**

Establish and validate a working CIDX server environment as the foundation for all remote mode testing.

[Conversation Reference: "REAL SERVER REQUIRED"]

## üìã **Feature Description**

**As a** Manual Tester
**I want to** have a reliable CIDX server environment
**So that** I can perform comprehensive remote mode testing against real infrastructure

## üèóÔ∏è **Feature Architecture**

### Server Infrastructure
```
Real CIDX Server Environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Server Process (python -m code_indexer.server.main --port 8095)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication System (admin/admin credentials)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API Endpoints (/auth/login, /api/repos, /api/query)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database Components (users_db, jobs_db)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Request/Response Logging
```

## üìö **Stories in Implementation Order**

### Story 0.1: Real Server Environment Setup
**Priority**: Highest (blocks all other testing)
**Focus**: Server startup, health verification, credential validation
**Success Criteria**: Working server on localhost:8095 with all APIs functional

[Implementation Order: Prerequisites before any other feature]

## üéØ **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] CIDX server runs stably on localhost:8095
- [ ] All core API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Admin authentication works with admin/admin credentials
- [ ] Server logs provide clear debugging information
- [ ] Server can be restarted reliably if needed

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Availability**: Server uptime > 99% during test execution
- **Response Time**: API endpoints respond within 1 second
- **Reliability**: Server restarts successfully without data loss
- **Monitoring**: Clear log output for all operations

## üöÄ **Implementation Timeline**

**Phase 0**: Foundation (MUST complete before any other testing)
- Server setup and validation
- API endpoint verification
- Authentication system confirmation
- Monitoring and logging validation

## üìù **Implementation Notes**

This feature is the absolute prerequisite for all remote mode testing. No other feature can be tested without a working server environment. The server must remain stable throughout the entire testing process.

**Critical Dependencies:**
- All other remote mode features depend on this
- Server must be running before any remote commands
- Authentication must work for all subsequent API calls
- Real data required (no mocks or simulations)
