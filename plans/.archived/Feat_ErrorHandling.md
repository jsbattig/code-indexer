# Feature 8: Error Handling

## 🎯 **Feature Intent**

Test network failures and error recovery mechanisms to ensure robust handling of connection issues and graceful degradation with clear user guidance.

[Conversation Reference: "08_Feat_ErrorHandling: Network failures and error recovery"]

## 📋 **Feature Summary**

This feature validates CIDX's error handling and recovery capabilities in remote mode, ensuring that network failures, authentication issues, and server problems are handled gracefully with clear guidance for users. Testing focuses on error scenarios, recovery mechanisms, and user experience during failures.

## 🔧 **Implementation Stories**

### Story 8.1: Network Error Testing
**Priority**: Medium - robustness validation
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Network timeout errors provide clear guidance
- Connection failures include actionable recovery steps
- Intermittent network issues are handled gracefully
