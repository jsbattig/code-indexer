# Feature 1: Connection Setup

## 🎯 **Feature Intent**

Initialize and verify remote CIDX connections through systematic manual testing of initialization commands and connection verification procedures.

[Conversation Reference: "01_Feat_ConnectionSetup: Initialize and verify remote CIDX connections"]

## 📋 **Feature Summary**

This feature validates the fundamental capability of CIDX to establish and verify connections to remote servers. Testing focuses on the initialization process, server connectivity validation, and proper configuration setup that enables all subsequent remote mode functionality.

## 🔧 **Implementation Stories**

### Story 1.1: Remote Initialization Testing
**Priority**: Highest - entry point for remote functionality
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Remote initialization commands execute successfully
- Configuration files are created correctly
- Server connectivity is validated during initialization

[Conversation Reference: "Remote initialization, connection verification"]

### Story 1.2: Connection Verification Testing
**Priority**: Highest - prerequisite for all remote operations
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Connection verification commands complete successfully
- Server health checks pass
- Authentication tokens are obtained and validated

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Setup Time**: Remote mode initialization completes in <60 seconds
- **Connection Validation**: Server connectivity confirmed before saving configuration
- **Configuration Creation**: Proper .code-indexer/.remote-config file creation
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for connection/authentication failures

## 🎯 **Story Implementation Checkboxes**

- [ ] **Story 1.1**: Remote Initialization Testing
  - [ ] Test python -m code_indexer.cli init --remote command with server URL
  - [ ] Test authentication parameter handling
  - [ ] Validate configuration file creation
  - [ ] Test error handling for invalid parameters

- [ ] **Story 1.2**: Connection Verification Testing
  - [ ] Test server connectivity validation

## 🏗️ **Dependencies**

### Prerequisites
- CIDX server running and accessible
- Valid test credentials
- Network connectivity to target server

### Blocks
- All subsequent feature testing depends on successful connection setup
- Authentication Security feature requires working connections
- Repository Management features require authenticated connections
