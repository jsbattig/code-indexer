# Epic: Real File-Level Parallel Processing

## 🎯 Epic Intent

Replace the current sequential file chunking bottleneck with parallel file submission using a dedicated FileChunkingManager that provides immediate feedback and eliminates silent processing periods.

## 📐 Overall Architecture

### Current Architecture Problems
```
Main Thread: File1→Chunk→File2→Chunk→File3→Chunk (SEQUENTIAL BOTTLENECK)
             ↓
Vector Pool: [idle] [idle] [idle] [idle] [idle] [idle] [idle] [idle]
```

### Target Architecture Solution  
```
Main Thread: File1→FilePool, File2→FilePool, File3→FilePool (IMMEDIATE SUBMISSION)
             ↓
File Pool:   [Chunk+Wait] [Chunk+Wait] [Chunk+Wait] (PARALLEL PROCESSING)
             ↓
Vector Pool: [Calc] [Calc] [Calc] [Calc] [Calc] [Calc] [Calc] [Calc]
```

## 🏗️ System Components

### Core Components
- **FileChunkingManager**: Thread pool executor (thread_count + 2 workers) for parallel file processing
- **Worker Thread Logic**: Each worker handles complete file lifecycle: chunk → submit to vectors → wait → write to Qdrant
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate "queued" status when files are submitted

### Technology Integration
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Simple thread pool for file-level parallelism
- **VectorCalculationManager**: Existing vector processing (unchanged)
- **Progress Callbacks**: Real-time status updates from worker threads
- **File Atomicity**: Complete file processing within single worker thread

- [x] 02_Story_ReplaceSequentialWithParallel
- [x] 03_Story_ProgressCallbackEnhancements
- [x] 04_Story_EliminateSilentPeriodsWithFeedback

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Immediate Feedback**: No more silent periods during file processing
- **Thread Utilization**: Vector threads utilized from the start (no idle waiting)
- **Small File Performance**: Parallel processing of small files vs sequential bottleneck
- **User Experience**: "Queued" feedback appears immediately upon file submission

## 🚀 Business Value

- **Developer Experience**: Immediate visual feedback eliminates "is it working?" concerns
- **Performance**: Parallel file processing improves throughput for repositories with many files
- **Simplicity**: Clean architectural change replaces sequential loop with parallel submission

## 📊 Dependencies

- Requires existing VectorCalculationManager (no changes needed)
- Integrates with existing progress callback system
- Maintains current file atomicity and error handling patterns
