# Story 10.1: Concurrent User Testing

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate concurrent multi-user remote operations and shared resource management through systematic manual testing procedures.

[Conversation Reference: "Concurrent user testing"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Team Lead
**I want to** verify that multiple developers can use remote CIDX simultaneously
**So that** the entire team can share indexed repositories without conflicts

[Conversation Reference: "Each test story specifies exact python -m code_indexer.cli commands to execute"]

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 10.1.1: Concurrent Query Execution
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Execute from multiple terminals/users simultaneously
# Terminal 1:
python -m code_indexer.cli query "authentication patterns" --limit 10
# Terminal 2 (simultaneously):
python -m code_indexer.cli query "database connection methods" --limit 10
# Terminal 3 (simultaneously):
python -m code_indexer.cli query "error handling strategies" --limit 10
```

**Expected Results:**
- All three concurrent queries complete successfully
- No query interference or resource contention
- Response times remain within acceptable limits for each user
- Each query returns appropriate, complete results

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: All concurrent queries succeed with acceptable individual performance
- ‚ùå FAIL: Query failures, interference, or significant performance degradation

[Conversation Reference: "Clear pass/fail criteria for manual verification"]

### Test 10.1.2: Concurrent Repository Management
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Multiple users managing repository connections
# User 1:
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "project-alpha"
python -m code_indexer.cli query "alpha specific code" --limit 5
# User 2 (different session):
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "project-beta"
python -m code_indexer.cli query "beta specific code" --limit 5
```

**Expected Results:**
- Both users can link to different repositories simultaneously
- Repository linking doesn't interfere between users
- Each user queries their respective linked repository correctly
- No cross-user repository context contamination

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Independent repository management per user with no cross-contamination
- ‚ùå FAIL: Repository linking interference or incorrect query contexts

### Test 10.1.3: Concurrent Branch Operations
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Multiple users working with different branches
# User 1:
python -m code_indexer.cli switch-branch main
python -m code_indexer.cli query "main branch functionality" --limit 8
# User 2:
python -m code_indexer.cli switch-branch feature-auth
python -m code_indexer.cli query "authentication features" --limit 8
```

**Expected Results:**
- Both users can switch branches independently
- Branch contexts maintained separately per user session
- Queries reflect correct branch context for each user
- No branch switching interference between users

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Independent branch contexts per user with correct query results
- ‚ùå FAIL: Branch context interference or incorrect branch-specific results

### Test 10.1.4: Load Testing with Multiple Users
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Simulate realistic team usage - 5 users with varied operations
# Users 1-3: Frequent queries
for i in {1..10}; do python -m code_indexer.cli query "load test query $i" --limit 3; sleep 1; done &
# User 4: Repository management
python -m code_indexer.cli list-repositories; sleep 2; python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "main-repo" &
# User 5: Branch operations
python -m code_indexer.cli list-branches; sleep 3; python -m code_indexer.cli switch-branch develop &
wait
```

**Expected Results:**
- All operations complete successfully under realistic load
- Server handles combined workload without degradation
- Individual user experience remains acceptable
- No resource exhaustion or connection limits reached

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Server handles realistic team load with acceptable individual performance
- ‚ùå FAIL: Server overload, resource exhaustion, or individual performance collapse

### Test 10.1.5: Authentication Independence Testing
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Multiple users with different authentication states
# User 1: Valid authentication
python -m code_indexer.cli query "auth test user 1" --limit 5
# User 2: Invalid/expired authentication (simulate)
python -m code_indexer.cli query "auth test user 2" --limit 5
# User 3: Fresh authentication
python -m code_indexer.cli reauth --username user3 --password pass3
python -m code_indexer.cli query "auth test user 3" --limit 5
```

**Expected Results:**
- User 1 operations succeed with valid authentication
- User 2 receives appropriate authentication error without affecting others
- User 3 can re-authenticate and operate independently
- Authentication states completely isolated between users

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Authentication isolation complete with independent user states
- ‚ùå FAIL: Authentication cross-contamination or shared state issues

### Test 10.1.6: Concurrent Staleness Checking
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Multiple users checking staleness simultaneously
# User 1:
python -m code_indexer.cli check-staleness --file-level &
# User 2:
python -m code_indexer.cli staleness-report --all-branches &
# User 3:
python -m code_indexer.cli query "concurrent staleness query" --check-staleness &
wait
```

**Expected Results:**
- All staleness operations complete without interference
- Staleness calculations accurate for each user's context
- No resource contention during concurrent staleness analysis
- Each operation returns appropriate results for user's repository state

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Concurrent staleness operations work independently with accurate results
- ‚ùå FAIL: Staleness calculation interference or inaccurate concurrent results

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Concurrent Success Rate**: 100% success for all concurrent operations
- **Performance Under Load**: Individual performance within 1.5x single-user baseline
- **Resource Management**: Server handles 5+ concurrent users without issues
- **Isolation Quality**: Complete user session and context isolation

[Conversation Reference: "Multi-user validation"]

## üéØ **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Multiple users can execute queries concurrently without interference
- [ ] Repository management operations work independently per user
- [ ] Branch contexts maintained separately for each user session
- [ ] Server handles realistic team load (5+ users) with acceptable performance
- [ ] Authentication states completely isolated between different users
- [ ] Concurrent staleness operations work independently with accurate results
- [ ] All multi-user operations maintain individual user context integrity
- [ ] Performance degradation minimal (< 50%) under concurrent usage

[Conversation Reference: "Clear acceptance criteria for manual assessment"]

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- CIDX server configured for multi-user access
- Multiple user accounts or authentication credentials available
- Ability to run multiple concurrent terminal sessions
- Test repositories with different branches and content

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Prepare multiple user authentication credentials
2. Set up multiple terminal sessions or testing environments
3. Ensure server has sufficient resources for concurrent testing
4. Have different repositories and branches available for testing

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. Verify no data corruption or cross-user contamination
2. Confirm server resource usage returns to normal after load testing
3. Test that individual user sessions work correctly after concurrent testing
4. Document any performance patterns or limitations discovered
