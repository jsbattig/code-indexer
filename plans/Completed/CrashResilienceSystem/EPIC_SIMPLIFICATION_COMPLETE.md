## API Simplification Summary

### Before
- **Total APIs**: 36
  - Queue Persistence (Story 1.1): 5 APIs
  - Job Reattachment (Story 1.2): 8 APIs
  - Aborted Startup (Story 1.3): 4 APIs
  - Statistics (Story 1.4): 4 APIs
  - Lock Persistence (Story 2.1): 5 APIs
  - Orphan Detection (Story 2.2): 4 APIs
  - Startup Recovery (Story 2.3): 5 APIs
  - Callback Delivery (Story 2.4): 4 APIs
  - Git Retry (Story 2.5): 2 APIs (stats/history)

### After

  - ✅ `GET /api/admin/startup-log` - Single API for complete recovery visibility

### API Reduction
- **Removed**: 36 APIs → 1 API
- **Reduction**: 97%

## Story Count Changes

### Before
- Feature 01: 5 stories
- Feature 02: 5 stories
- **Total**: 10 stories

### After
- Feature 01: 4 stories (Story 1.3 removed, 1.4→1.3, 1.5→1.4)
- Feature 02: 5 stories (2.6→2.5)
- **Total**: 9 stories

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Story 1.3 (Cleanup Resumption) - REMOVED
**User Decision**: "Don't do this. this is extremely hard to control. remove this."
- Removed multi-phase checkpointed cleanup
- Orphan detection (Story 2.2) handles leaked resources instead
- Simpler approach: Accept interrupted cleanup leaks resources, clean up later

### 2. Degraded Mode - REDEFINED
**User Decision**: "No features can be disabled, that's a hard error. by favor operation I mean, if a repo or job is corrupted, that becomes unusable, but the system needs to start intact."

**OLD (WRONG)**:
- Lock recovery fails → Lock enforcement disabled system-wide

**NEW (CORRECT)**:
- Lock recovery fails for repo-B → ONLY repo-B marked "unavailable"
- Lock enforcement remains ENABLED system-wide
- All other locks work normally
- NO feature disabling ever occurs

### 3. Manual Intervention APIs - ALL REMOVED
**User Decision**: "Overkill. Recovery should be completely automated, no APIs, log error conditions..."

- Removed all 26 inspection APIs
- Removed all 10 manual intervention APIs
- Kept ONLY single startup log API
- Philosophy: Fully automated recovery with comprehensive structured logging

### 4. Output Capture Clarification - Story 1.2
**User Feedback**: "Make sure the spec is clear we can't run the process and try to capture stdout."

Added explicit specification:
- **NO stdout/stderr capture possible** (background processes)
- Job output via markdown files written by adaptors
- StateReconstructor renamed to MarkdownReader

### 5. Webhook Storage - CONFIRMED
**User Decision**: "Yes, that's good."

- File-based: `callbacks.queue.json`
- Atomic operations
- Exponential backoff: 30s, 2min, 10min

## Structured Logging Standard

All stories now use consistent structured logging format:

```json
{
  "component": "QueueRecovery" | "JobReattachment" | "LockRecovery" | "OrphanDetection" | "CallbackDelivery" | "GitRetry",
  "operation": "recovery_completed" | "reattachment_completed" | etc,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:00:30.123Z",
  "duration_ms": 1234,
  "status": "success" | "partial_success" | "failed",
  "details": { /* operation-specific fields */ }
}
```

## Startup Log API - Single API Specification

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/startup-log`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "current_startup": {
    "startup_timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:00:00.000Z",
    "total_duration_ms": 5678,
    "degraded_mode": true,
    "corrupted_resources": ["lock:repo-B"],
    "operations": [
      { /* QueueRecovery operation */ },
      { /* JobReattachment operation */ },
      { /* LockRecovery operation */ },
      { /* OrphanDetection operation */ },
      { /* CallbackDelivery operation */ }
    ]
  },
  "startup_history": [
    { /* Previous startup log */ }
  ]
}
```

## Updated Problem Coverage

### Problems REMOVED
- ❌ **Problem #5**: Interrupted Cleanup = Resource Leaks (Story 1.3 removed)

**New Approach**: Orphan detection (Story 2.2) handles leaked resources

### Problems Addressed (14 total)
1. Queue State Loss → Story 1.1
2. Job Metadata Corruption → Story 1.1
3. Running Jobs Lost → Story 1.2
4. PID Unreliability → Story 1.2
5. ~~Interrupted Cleanup~~ → Story 2.2 (orphan detection)
6. Lock Loss → Story 2.1
7. Orphaned Resources → Story 2.2
8. Aborted Startup → Story 1.3 (renumbered)
9. No Recovery Visibility → Story 2.3
10. Race Conditions → Story 2.3
11. Lost Webhooks → Story 2.4
12. Statistics Loss → Story 1.4 (renumbered)
13. Git Failures → Story 2.5 (renumbered)
14. Degraded Mode → Story 2.3 (redefined)
15. No Manual Intervention → Addressed by removing ALL manual APIs

## Success Metrics

- **Zero data loss**: All state preserved across any restart
- **Automatic recovery**: 100% automated, no manual intervention
- **60-second recovery**: Full recovery within 60 seconds
- **Complete visibility**: Single startup log API provides full observability
- **97% API reduction**: 36 APIs → 1 API
- **Resource protection**: Orphan detection handles leaked resources
- **Graceful degradation**: System operational with corrupted resource marking
- **9 stories**: Reduced from 10 (1 removed as too complex)

## Implementation Ready

All 9 story files are now:
- ✅ Fully automated recovery specified
- ✅ Manual APIs removed (except single startup log API)
- ✅ Structured logging patterns defined
- ✅ Degraded mode correctly specified (resource marking, not feature disabling)
- ✅ Test plans updated for automated verification
- ✅ Acceptance criteria updated
- ✅ Ready for implementation via TDD workflow
