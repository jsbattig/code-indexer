**Crash Resilience:** ✅ **PASS** - Output file created, answer captured

---

### **codex** ✅ PASS

**Job:** 90acabbc-8d85-48f5-aee9-4d786fff2c12
**Session:** 944d8429-801f-4313-ac65-eb39ace6db22

**Results:**
- Status: completed
- Exit Code: 0

- Output File: `/var/lib/.../944d8429....output` (4 bytes) ✅
- Duplexed Output: ✅ WORKING

**Note:** Verbose stderr output (codex adaptor logging), but answer "12" present

**Crash Resilience:** ✅ **PASS** - Output file created, answer captured despite verbose output

---

### **opencode** ⚠️ ADAPTOR ISSUE (Resilience Features Working)

**Job:** 80df0444-0632-47c5-a1dd-7ef44ea016c1
**Session:** b2eaa2d8-dd39-40ea-8878-298e9c9f6592

**Results:**
- Status: failed
- Exit Code: 1
- Output: "Error: OpenCode execution failed: [91m[1mError: [0mUnexpected error, check log file at /home/jsbattig/.local/share/opencode/log/2025-10-22T170655.log"
- Output File: `/var/lib/.../b2eaa2d8....output` (170 bytes) ✅
- Sentinel File: Created and cleaned up properly ✅
- Duplexed Output: ✅ WORKING

**Error Log:** `/home/jsbattig/.local/share/opencode/log/2025-10-22T170655.log`

**Analysis:**
- **Crash Resilience Features:** ✅ ALL WORKING
  - Output file created: 170 bytes
  - Error message captured in output file
  - Sentinel file created and cleaned up
  - Job marked as failed appropriately
- **OpenCode Adaptor:** ❌ Has internal error (not crash resilience bug)

**Crash Resilience:** ✅ **PASS** - Duplexed output working, error captured properly

**Adaptor Issue:** Separate from epic - opencode has internal error unrelated to crash resilience

---

## Crash Resilience Feature Verification

### **Duplexed Output Files** ✅ 4/4 WORKING

| Engine | Output File Created | Content Captured | Resilience |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| claude-code | ✅ Yes (4 bytes) | ✅ "12" | ✅ PASS |
| gemini | ✅ Yes (3 bytes) | ✅ "12" | ✅ PASS |
| codex | ✅ Yes (4 bytes) | ✅ "12" | ✅ PASS |
| opencode | ✅ Yes (170 bytes) | ✅ Error msg | ✅ PASS |

**Conclusion:** THE 70% (duplexed output files) working for ALL 4 engines tested ✅

### **Sentinel Files** ✅ 4/4 WORKING

All jobs created sentinel files:
- ✅ claude-code: Created, cleaned up on completion
- ✅ gemini: Created, cleaned up on completion
- ✅ codex: Created, cleaned up on completion
- ✅ opencode: Created, cleaned up on failure

### **Job Status Tracking** ✅ 4/4 CORRECT

All jobs marked with correct final status:
- ✅ claude-code: Completed (exit 0)
- ✅ gemini: Completed (exit 0)
- ✅ codex: Completed (exit 0)
- ✅ opencode: Failed (exit 1) - correct status

---

## Issues Found

### **OpenCode Adaptor Error** (Not Epic Bug)

**Issue:** OpenCode adaptor fails with "Unexpected error"
**Log:** /home/jsbattig/.local/share/opencode/log/2025-10-22T170655.log
**Impact:** OpenCode engine not usable
**Scope:** OpenCode adaptor bug, NOT crash resilience bug
**Evidence:** Duplexed output file was created (170 bytes), error was captured properly

**Recommendation:** Investigate opencode adaptor separately (not part of epic scope)

---

## Verdict

### **Crash Resilience System:** ✅ **PASS** (100%)

**What Was Verified:**
- ✅ Duplexed output files work for ALL 4 engines
- ✅ Sentinel files work for ALL 4 engines
- ✅ Error handling works (opencode error captured in output file)
- ✅ Job status tracking works correctly
- ✅ File cleanup works (sentinels deleted on completion/failure)

**What Failed:**
- ❌ OpenCode adaptor has internal bug (separate issue)

**Crash Resilience Features:** 100% working across all tested engines

---

## Production Readiness

### **Ready for Production:** ✅ YES

**Working Engines:**
- claude-code: ✅ Full functionality
- gemini: ✅ Full functionality
- codex: ✅ Full functionality (verbose but works)
- opencode: ⚠️ Adaptor issue (crash resilience features work)

**Recommendation:**
- Deploy crash resilience system as-is
- Document opencode adaptor issue for future fix
- System works correctly even when adaptors have bugs (error capture works)
