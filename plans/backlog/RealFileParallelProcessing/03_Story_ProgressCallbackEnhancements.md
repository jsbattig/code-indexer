# Story: Progress Callback Enhancements

## üìñ User Story

As a **user**, I want **enhanced progress callbacks that show immediate queuing feedback and real-time processing status** so that **I can track file processing progress without silent periods and understand what the system is doing at all times**.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### Given progress callback enhancements implementation

#### Scenario: Immediate Queuing Status Updates
- [ ] **Given** files being submitted to parallel processing
- [ ] **When** each file is queued for processing  
- [ ] **Then** immediate callback: progress_callback(0, 0, file_path, info="üì• Queued for processing")
- [ ] **And** hook point: FileChunkingManager.submit_file_for_processing() method entry
- [ ] **And** queuing feedback appears within 10ms of submission
- [ ] **And** users see files being acknowledged immediately
- [ ] **And** no silent periods during file queuing phase

#### Scenario: Worker Thread Status Updates
- [ ] **Given** files being processed in worker threads
- [ ] **When** worker threads report processing progress
- [ ] **Then** status updates: "üîÑ Processing file.py (chunk 5/12, 42%)"
- [ ] **And** hook point: Worker thread _process_file_complete_lifecycle() during chunk processing
- [ ] **And** progress shows real-time chunk completion within files
- [ ] **And** worker thread activity visible to users
- [ ] **And** processing status distinct from queuing status

#### Scenario: File Completion Notifications
- [ ] **Given** file completing all processing stages
- [ ] **When** worker thread completes file processing
- [ ] **Then** completion callback: "‚úÖ Completed file.py (12 chunks, 2.3s)"
- [ ] **And** hook point: Worker thread _process_file_complete_lifecycle() before return
- [ ] **And** completion status appears immediately after Qdrant write
- [ ] **And** processing time and chunk count included in feedback
- [ ] **And** users see immediate completion acknowledgment

#### Scenario: Error Status Reporting
- [ ] **Given** file processing encountering errors
- [ ] **When** chunking, vector processing, or Qdrant writing fails
- [ ] **Then** error callback: "‚ùå Failed file.py - Vector processing timeout"
- [ ] **And** hook point: Worker thread _process_file_complete_lifecycle() exception handling blocks
- [ ] **And** specific error context provided to user
- [ ] **And** error status visually distinct from success status
- [ ] **And** error feedback appears immediately upon detection

#### Scenario: Overall Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Given** multiple files processing in parallel
- [ ] **When** files complete at different rates
- [ ] **Then** overall progress: "15/100 files (15%) | 2.3 files/s | 8 threads active"
- [ ] **And** hook point: Main thread as_completed(file_futures) loop (replacing current line 492)
- [ ] **And** progress percentage reflects actual completed files
- [ ] **And** processing rate calculated from actual completions
- [ ] **And** thread activity status included in progress

### Pseudocode Algorithm

```
Class ProgressCallbackEnhancements:
    Trigger_immediate_queuing_feedback(file_path, callback):
        If callback:
            callback(
                current=0,
                total=0, 
                path=file_path,
                info="üì• Queued for processing"
            )
            
    Report_worker_processing_status(file_path, chunks_completed, total_chunks, callback):
        progress_pct = (chunks_completed / total_chunks) * 100
        status = f"üîÑ Processing {file_path.name} (chunk {chunks_completed}/{total_chunks}, {progress_pct:.0f}%)"
        
        If callback:
            callback(0, 0, file_path, info=status)
            
    Report_file_completion(file_path, chunks_processed, processing_time, callback):
        status = f"‚úÖ Completed {file_path.name} ({chunks_processed} chunks, {processing_time:.1f}s)"
        
        If callback:
            callback(0, 0, file_path, info=status)
            
    Report_file_error(file_path, error_message, callback):
        status = f"‚ùå Failed {file_path.name} - {error_message}"
        
        If callback:
            callback(0, 0, file_path, info=status)
            
    Update_overall_progress(completed_files, total_files, files_per_second, callback):
        progress_pct = (completed_files / total_files) * 100
        status = f"{completed_files}/{total_files} files ({progress_pct:.0f}%) | {files_per_second:.1f} files/s"
        
        If callback:
            callback(completed_files, total_files, Path(""), info=status)
```
