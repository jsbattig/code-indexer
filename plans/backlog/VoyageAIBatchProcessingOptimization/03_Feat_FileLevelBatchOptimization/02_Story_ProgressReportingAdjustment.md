# Story: Progress Reporting Adjustment for Batch Operations

## üìñ User Story

As a user monitoring indexing progress, I want progress reporting to remain smooth and accurate despite internal batch processing so that the user experience is identical to before while benefiting from dramatically improved processing speed.

## üéØ Business Value

After this story completion, users will experience the same responsive progress reporting they're accustomed to, but with much faster overall processing due to batch optimization, maintaining excellent user experience while delivering performance benefits.

## üìç Implementation Target

**File**: `/src/code_indexer/services/file_chunking_manager.py`  
**Lines**: 196-204 and other progress callback locations in `_process_file_clean_lifecycle()`

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Progress calculation accuracy with batch processing
```gherkin
Given file processing using batch operations instead of individual chunks
When progress callbacks are triggered during file processing
Then progress percentages should remain accurate for overall file count
And file completion tracking should reflect actual file completion status
And progress updates should occur at appropriate intervals for user feedback
And total file count and completed file count should be consistent

Given a processing session with 50 files being indexed
When batch processing completes files at different rates
Then progress should show accurate X/50 files completed
And percentage calculation should be correct (completed/total * 100)
And progress updates should be smooth despite internal batching differences
And final progress should reach exactly 100% when all files complete
```

### Scenario: File-level progress granularity adjustment
```gherkin
Given the shift from chunk-level to file-level batch processing
When progress reporting needs to account for batch completion timing
Then progress updates should occur when entire files complete (not individual chunks)
And file completion should trigger progress callback with updated counts
And progress smoothness should be maintained despite larger completion increments
And users should experience responsive feedback throughout processing

Given files of varying sizes processed as batches
When small files (few chunks) complete quickly and large files take longer
Then progress reporting should handle variable completion timing gracefully
And overall progress should remain predictable and smooth for users
And processing speed indicators should reflect the improved batch performance
```

### Scenario: Concurrent files data integration with batch processing
```gherkin
Given the CleanSlotTracker managing concurrent file processing state
When files are processed using batch operations
Then concurrent files display should accurately reflect batch processing status
And slot utilization should be correctly reported for batch operations
And file status updates should align with batch processing completion
And real-time file tracking should work correctly with batch timing

Given concurrent file processing with batch operations
When the slot tracker provides concurrent files data for display
Then file processing states should be accurate (processing, completed)
And active thread information should reflect batch processing workload
And file names and processing states should update appropriately
And progress display should show meaningful status for batch operations
```

### Scenario: Performance metrics accuracy with batch processing
```gherkin
Given batch processing improving overall throughput significantly
When progress reporting includes performance metrics (files/s, KB/s, threads)
Then files per second should reflect the improved processing rate
And KB per second should accurately represent data processing throughput
And thread utilization should be reported accurately for batch processing
And performance improvements should be visible to users in real-time

Given the dramatic throughput improvements from batch processing
When progress information includes speed metrics
Then speed calculations should account for batch processing efficiency
And metrics should reflect the true performance improvements achieved
And users should see evidence of the optimization through better speeds
And progress reporting should showcase the performance benefits clearly
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Progress Callback Timing Changes
```pseudocode
# Current: Progress update per chunk completion (removed)
# for each chunk completion:
#     progress_callback(completed_chunks, total_chunks, ...)

# New: Progress update per file completion (implement)
# when file batch processing completes:
progress_callback(
    completed_files,      # Increment when entire file completes
    total_files,          # Total files to process
    file_path,           # Current completed file
    info=progress_info,   # Include batch processing performance metrics
    concurrent_files=concurrent_files_data
)
```

### Progress Information Enhancement
```pseudocode
# Enhanced progress info reflecting batch performance
progress_info = (
    f"{completed_files}/{total_files} files ({percentage}%) | "
    f"{files_per_second:.1f} files/s | "    # Improved due to batching
    f"{kb_per_second:.1f} KB/s | "          # Improved throughput
    f"{active_threads} threads | "
    f"{current_file.name}"
)
```
