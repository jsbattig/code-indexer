# Epic: Real-Time File State Updates

## 🎯 Epic Intent

Implement async display worker architecture that provides real-time visibility of every file state change without compromising parallel processing performance. Replace the current file-completion-only progress updates with immediate state change display using queue-based async processing.

## 📐 Overall Architecture

### Current Problem
```
Worker Thread State Change → ConsolidatedFileTracker → [DEAD END]
                                                      ↓
Main Thread File Completion → progress_callback → Display Update (every 30+ seconds)
```

### Target Architecture Solution  
```
Worker Thread State Change → [Queue Event] → AsyncDisplayWorker → Complete Progress Calculation → CLI Update
     (immediate return)        (non-blocking)      (async)              (real data)            (real-time)
```

## 🏗️ System Components

### Core Components
- **AsyncDisplayWorker**: Dedicated thread for async display calculations and updates
- **StateChangeEvent Queue**: Non-blocking communication between workers and display
- **Central State Reader**: Pulls complete state from ConsolidatedFileTracker for calculations
- **Overflow Protection**: Queue management with intelligent event dropping

### Technology Integration
- **Queue-based Async Processing**: Non-blocking state change events with dedicated processing thread
- **ConsolidatedFileTracker Integration**: Central state store for complete file status data
- **Real Progress Calculations**: Accurate files/s, KB/s, percentages from actual state
- **CLI Display Integration**: Existing progress_callback system with complete progress data

- [x] 02_Story_NonBlockingStateChanges  
- [x] 03_Story_QueueBasedEventProcessing
- [x] 04_Story_RealTimeProgressCalculations

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Real-Time State Visibility**: Every state change appears in display within 10ms
- **Zero Worker Blocking**: State changes return immediately with no performance impact
- **Complete Progress Data**: All calculations (files/s, KB/s, percentages) accurate and real-time
- **All File Status Visible**: Complete view of all 14 workers with current states

## 🚀 Business Value

- **Developer Experience**: Real-time visibility into file processing progress eliminates uncertainty
- **Performance Monitoring**: Immediate feedback on processing bottlenecks and worker utilization
- **System Transparency**: Complete visibility into parallel processing state without compromises

## 📊 Dependencies

- Builds on existing FileChunkingManager parallel processing architecture
- Integrates with existing ConsolidatedFileTracker central state store
- Enhances existing CLI progress display system without breaking changes
- Maintains all parallel processing performance improvements
