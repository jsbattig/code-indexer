# Story: Basic Health Checks

[Conversation Reference: "Basic health status checking" - Context: Basic and detailed health checks]

## Story Overview

**Objective**: Implement CLI commands to check basic system health status using available server endpoints.

**User Value**: Users and administrators can quickly verify if the system is operational and responding correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `cidx system health` command checks basic system health
- [ ] Health status display with clear OK/ERROR indicators
- [ ] Response time measurement for health endpoints
- [ ] Uses GET /health endpoint for basic health check
- [ ] Available to all authenticated users

## Technical Implementation

### CLI Command Structure
```bash
cidx system health [--verbose]
```

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: GET `/health`
- **Client**: `SystemAPIClient.check_health()`
- **Authentication**: May not require authentication for basic health
- **Response**: Health status and basic system information

### Health Display Format
```
System Health: OK
Response Time: 45ms
Status: All services operational
```

### Verbose Mode
- Additional health details when --verbose flag used
- Service-level health information
- Timestamp of last health check

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Health command implemented with clear status display
- [ ] API client method created with error handling
- [ ] Response time measurement included
- [ ] Verbose mode provides additional details
- [ ] Health status clearly communicated to user
- [ ] Unit tests cover success and failure scenarios (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration test validates health check workflow

**Story Points**: 2
**Dependencies**: Basic authentication functionality should be available
**Risk Level**: Low - read-only health check operation
