# Story: Enhanced Sync Integration

[Conversation Reference: "Integration with existing sync functionality"]

## Story Overview

**Objective**: Enhance the existing `cidx sync` command with repository context awareness and integrate seamlessly with the repository management system, providing comprehensive synchronization capabilities.

**User Value**: Users can synchronize their activated repositories with golden repositories using familiar sync commands while gaining enhanced functionality for repository-aware operations and conflict resolution.

**Acceptance Criteria Summary**: Enhanced sync command with repository context detection, conflict resolution, and seamless integration with existing sync workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Repository-Aware Sync Enhancement
**Scenario**: Existing sync command detects and works with repository context
```gherkin
Given I am in an activated repository directory
When I execute "cidx sync"
Then the system should detect the repository context automatically
And sync with the corresponding golden repository
And display "Syncing repository 'my-project' with golden repository 'web-app'"
And show sync progress with repository-specific information
And maintain backward compatibility with existing sync behavior

Given I am not in a repository directory
When I execute "cidx sync"
Then the system should behave as it currently does
And maintain existing sync functionality
And not attempt repository-specific operations
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Enhance existing `cidx sync` command with repository context detection
- [ ] Auto-detect activated repository from current working directory
- [ ] Integrate with repository-specific sync endpoints
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing sync behavior
- [ ] Display repository-aware progress and status information
- [ ] Use existing sync infrastructure with repository enhancements

### AC2: Explicit Repository Sync Operations
**Scenario**: User explicitly syncs specific repositories
```gherkin
Given I have activated repositories
When I execute "cidx repos sync my-project"
Then the system should sync the specified repository with its golden repository
And display detailed sync progress and status
And show any conflicts or issues that arise
And provide resolution guidance for conflicts
And update repository sync status after completion

Given I want to sync all my repositories
When I execute "cidx repos sync --all"
Then the system should sync all activated repositories
And display progress for each repository
And summarize results for all sync operations
And report any repositories that failed to sync
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement `cidx repos sync` command for explicit repository sync
- [ ] Add `--all` option to sync all activated repositories
- [ ] Integrate with existing sync progress reporting
- [ ] Handle multiple repository sync operations
- [ ] Provide comprehensive sync status reporting
- [ ] Support both individual and bulk sync operations

### AC3: Sync Conflict Detection and Resolution
**Scenario**: User handles sync conflicts effectively
```gherkin
Given my repository has uncommitted changes
When I execute sync operation
Then the system should detect uncommitted changes
And display "Repository has uncommitted changes that may conflict"
And offer options: stash changes, commit changes, or abort sync
And guide user through conflict resolution process

Given sync operation encounters merge conflicts
When conflicts arise during sync
Then the system should display "Sync conflicts detected in <files>"
And show conflicted files and conflict markers
And provide guidance for manual conflict resolution
And offer to open merge tool or editor
And allow user to complete resolution before continuing
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Detect uncommitted changes before sync operations
- [ ] Handle merge conflicts during sync with clear reporting
- [ ] Provide conflict resolution guidance and options
- [ ] Support stashing and unstashing of local changes
- [ ] Integrate with merge tools for conflict resolution
- [ ] Allow sync resumption after conflict resolution

### AC4: Sync Status and History Tracking
**Scenario**: User monitors sync status and history
```gherkin
Given I have repositories with sync history
When I execute "cidx repos sync-status"
Then the system should display sync status for all repositories
And show last sync time and success/failure status
And indicate repositories needing sync
And display sync conflicts requiring resolution
And provide sync history summary

Given I want detailed sync information
When I execute "cidx repos sync-status my-project --detailed"
Then the system should show comprehensive sync information
And display sync history with timestamps
And show conflict resolution history
And indicate changes synchronized in recent syncs
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement `cidx repos sync-status` command for sync monitoring
- [ ] Add `--detailed` option for comprehensive sync information
- [ ] Track and display sync history and timestamps
- [ ] Monitor sync status across all repositories
- [ ] Provide actionable sync status information
- [ ] Show sync conflicts and resolution status

### AC5: Integration with Existing Sync Infrastructure
**Scenario**: Enhanced sync leverages existing sync capabilities
```gherkin
Given existing sync functionality works properly
When repository-aware sync is used
Then all existing sync features should continue working
And repository context should enhance rather than replace functionality
And existing sync configurations should be respected
And sync progress reporting should use established patterns
And error handling should follow existing conventions

Given user has existing sync automation or scripts
When enhanced sync is deployed
Then existing automation should continue working unchanged
And new repository features should be opt-in
And CLI interface should remain compatible
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Maintain complete backward compatibility with existing sync
- [ ] Enhance rather than replace existing sync infrastructure
- [ ] Use established progress reporting and error handling patterns
- [ ] Respect existing sync configurations and settings
- [ ] Ensure existing automation and scripts continue working
- [ ] Make repository features additive, not disruptive

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Sync Command Structure
```python
# Enhance existing sync command with repository detection
@cli.command()
@click.option("--repository", help="Sync specific repository")
@click.option("--all-repos", is_flag=True, help="Sync all repositories")
def sync(repository: str, all_repos: bool):
    """Sync with enhanced repository awareness."""
    # Detect repository context if not specified
    # Use existing sync infrastructure with repository enhancements
    # Maintain backward compatibility

# New repository-specific sync commands
@repos.command()
@click.argument("user_alias", required=False)
@click.option("--all", is_flag=True, help="Sync all repositories")
def sync(user_alias: str, all: bool):
    """Sync repositories with golden repositories."""

@repos.command(name="sync-status")
@click.argument("user_alias", required=False)
@click.option("--detailed", is_flag=True, help="Show detailed sync information")
def sync_status(user_alias: str, detailed: bool):
    """Show repository sync status."""
```

### Repository Context Detection
```python
class RepositoryContextDetector:
    @staticmethod
    def detect_repository_context(cwd: Path) -> Optional[Repository]:
        """Detect if current directory is in an activated repository."""

    @staticmethod
    def find_repository_root(path: Path) -> Optional[Path]:
        """Find repository root directory walking up from path."""

    @staticmethod
    def get_repository_config(repo_path: Path) -> Optional[RepositoryConfig]:
        """Get repository configuration for sync operations."""
```

### Sync Integration Architecture
```python
class EnhancedSyncManager:
    def __init__(self, legacy_sync_manager: SyncManager):
        self.legacy_sync = legacy_sync_manager
        self.repo_client = ReposAPIClient()

    def sync_with_context(self, repository_context: Optional[Repository]):
        """Sync with repository context awareness."""

    def sync_repository(self, user_alias: str) -> SyncResult:
        """Sync specific repository with golden repository."""

    def sync_all_repositories(self) -> Dict[str, SyncResult]:
        """Sync all activated repositories."""
```
