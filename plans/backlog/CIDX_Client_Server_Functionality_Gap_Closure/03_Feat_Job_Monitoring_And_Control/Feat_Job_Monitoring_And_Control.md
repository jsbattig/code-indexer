# Feature: Job Monitoring and Control

[Conversation Reference: "Background job visibility and status checking, job cancellation capabilities, job listing with filtering"]

## Feature Overview

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive background job monitoring and control capabilities through CLI commands, enabling users to monitor job status, cancel operations, and manage job lifecycle effectively.

**Business Value**: Provides operational visibility into long-running operations like repository sync, indexing, and maintenance tasks, enabling users to monitor progress and manage resource utilization effectively.

**Priority**: 3 (Operational capability building on repository management)

## Technical Architecture

### Command Structure Extension
```
cidx jobs
├── list           # List background jobs with filtering options
├── status         # Show detailed job status and progress
└── cancel         # Cancel running or queued jobs
```

### API Integration Points
**Jobs Client**: New `JobsAPIClient` extending `CIDXRemoteAPIClient`
**Endpoints**:
- GET `/api/jobs` - List jobs with filtering
- GET `/api/jobs/{job_id}` - Job details and status
- DELETE `/api/jobs/{job_id}` - Cancel job

### Job Lifecycle Architecture

## Story Implementation Order

### Story 1: Job Status and Listing
[Conversation Reference: "List and monitor background jobs"]
- [ ] **01_Story_JobStatusAndListing** - Job visibility and monitoring
  **Value**: Users can see what background operations are running and their status
  **Scope**: List jobs, show progress, filter by status, monitor execution

### Story 2: Job Control Operations
[Conversation Reference: "Cancel and manage job execution"]
- [ ] **02_Story_JobControlOperations** - Job lifecycle control
  **Value**: Users can cancel long-running operations
  **Scope**: Cancel jobs only - matching available server endpoint DELETE /api/jobs/{job_id}


## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Job Data Model
```python
@dataclass
class Job:
    job_id: str
    job_type: str
    description: str
    status: str  # 'queued', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'
    progress: float
    created_at: datetime
    started_at: Optional[datetime]
    completed_at: Optional[datetime]
    user_id: str
    repository: Optional[str]
    error_message: Optional[str]

@dataclass
class JobProgress:
    current_step: str
    steps_completed: int
    total_steps: int
    estimated_remaining: Optional[int]
    detailed_status: Dict[str, Any]
```

### API Client Architecture
```python
class JobsAPIClient(CIDXRemoteAPIClient):
    """Job monitoring and control client"""

    def list_jobs(self, status: Optional[str] = None, job_type: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Job]
    def get_job_status(self, job_id: str) -> Job
    def cancel_job(self, job_id: str) -> CancelResponse
```

## Quality and Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Standards
- Unit tests >95% for job management logic
- Integration tests for all job lifecycle operations
- Performance tests for job monitoring at scale
- Error handling tests for various job failure scenarios

### Job Operation Testing
- Job listing and filtering accuracy
- Job cancellation effectiveness and cleanup
- Progress monitoring accuracy and real-time updates
- History tracking completeness and accuracy

### Performance Requirements
- Job listing operations complete within 2 seconds
- Job status updates real-time with <1 second latency
- Job cancellation effective within 5 seconds

## Integration Specifications

### Repository Operation Integration
**Job Creation**: Repository operations automatically create trackable jobs
**Progress Integration**: Use existing progress reporting for job status
**Sync Integration**: Sync operations become monitorable background jobs
**Resource Coordination**: Jobs coordinate with container and resource management

### Cross-Feature Dependencies
**Authentication**: Jobs require authentication and user context
**Repository Management**: Repository operations generate trackable jobs
**Administrative Functions**: Admin operations create administrative jobs
**System Health**: Job health contributes to overall system health monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### Operational Risks
**Risk**: Job cancellation leaving system in inconsistent state
**Mitigation**: Implement proper job cleanup and rollback procedures

**Risk**: Resource leaks from failed or cancelled jobs
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive resource tracking and cleanup validation

**Risk**: Job monitoring overwhelming system resources
**Mitigation**: Efficient job status caching and update throttling

### Performance Risks
**Risk**: Large numbers of jobs degrading performance
**Mitigation**: Job pagination, archiving, and cleanup automation
