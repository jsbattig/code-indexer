# Story: Explicit Authentication Commands

[Conversation Reference: "Login, register, logout commands"]

## Story Overview

**Objective**: Implement explicit login, register, and logout commands to provide users with complete control over their authentication state and session management.

**User Value**: Users can explicitly authenticate with the CIDX server, register new accounts, and properly logout to clear credentials, providing clear session boundaries and security control.

**Acceptance Criteria Summary**: Complete authentication workflow with explicit commands for login, registration, and logout with secure credential management.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Explicit Login Command Implementation
**Scenario**: User authenticates with explicit login command
```gherkin
Given I have CIDX client configured for remote mode
And I have valid username and password credentials
When I execute "cidx auth login --username <user> --password <pass>"
Then the system should authenticate with the server
And store encrypted credentials locally
And display "Successfully logged in as <user>"
And set authentication status to active
And enable access to authenticated commands
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement `cidx auth login` command with username/password parameters
- [ ] Integrate with POST `/auth/login` endpoint
- [ ] Store JWT token and refresh token using AES-256 encryption
- [ ] Validate server response and handle authentication errors
- [ ] Display clear success/failure messages using Rich console

### AC2: User Registration Command Implementation
**Scenario**: New user registers account through CLI
```gherkin
Given I have CIDX client configured for remote mode
And I have chosen a valid username and password
When I execute "cidx auth register --username <user> --password <pass> --role user"
Then the system should create a new user account
And authenticate the newly created user
And store encrypted credentials locally
And display "Successfully registered and logged in as <user>"
And set authentication status to active
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement `cidx auth register` command with username/password/role parameters
- [ ] Integrate with POST `/auth/register` endpoint
- [ ] Support role specification (user/admin) with default to 'user'
- [ ] Automatically login after successful registration
- [ ] Handle registration errors (username conflicts, password policy violations)
- [ ] Display appropriate feedback for registration success/failure

### AC3: Explicit Logout Command Implementation
**Scenario**: User explicitly logs out and clears credentials
```gherkin
Given I am currently authenticated with stored credentials
When I execute "cidx auth logout"
Then the system should clear all stored credentials
And remove encryption keys from local storage
And display "Successfully logged out"
And set authentication status to inactive
And disable access to authenticated commands
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement `cidx auth logout` command with no parameters
- [ ] Clear all stored JWT tokens and refresh tokens
- [ ] Remove encrypted credential files securely
- [ ] Reset authentication status in local configuration
- [ ] Display logout confirmation message
- [ ] Handle logout when not currently authenticated

### AC4: Interactive Authentication Flow
**Scenario**: User provides credentials interactively for security
```gherkin
Given I have CIDX client configured for remote mode
When I execute "cidx auth login" without parameters
Then the system should prompt "Username:" securely
And I enter my username
And the system should prompt "Password:" with hidden input
And I enter my password
And the system should authenticate using provided credentials
And display authentication result
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Support interactive credential entry when parameters not provided
- [ ] Use `getpass` module for secure password input (no echo)
- [ ] Validate input format and handle empty inputs
- [ ] Provide clear prompts and error messages
- [ ] Support CLI parameter and interactive mode consistently

### AC5: Authentication Error Handling
**Scenario**: Authentication fails with clear error reporting
```gherkin
Given I have CIDX client configured for remote mode
When I execute "cidx auth login" with invalid credentials
Then the system should display "Authentication failed: Invalid username or password"
And not store any credentials locally
And maintain unauthenticated status
And provide guidance for password reset if needed

When I execute "cidx auth register" with existing username
Then the system should display "Registration failed: Username already exists"
And not modify existing authentication state
And suggest alternative usernames or login

When the server is unreachable during authentication
Then the system should display "Server connection failed: Unable to reach CIDX server"
And provide troubleshooting guidance
And not corrupt existing stored credentials
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Handle HTTP error codes (401, 403, 409, 500) with specific messages
- [ ] Handle network connectivity issues with appropriate feedback
- [ ] Preserve existing credentials when authentication attempts fail
- [ ] Provide helpful error messages without exposing security details
- [ ] Include troubleshooting guidance in error messages

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Structure
```python
@cli.group(name="auth")
@require_mode("remote")
def auth():
    """Authentication management commands for CIDX server."""
    pass

@auth.command()
@click.option("--username", "-u", help="Username for authentication")
@click.option("--password", "-p", help="Password for authentication")
def login(username: str, password: str):
    """Login to CIDX server with credentials."""

@auth.command()
@click.option("--username", "-u", required=True, help="Username for new account")
@click.option("--password", "-p", help="Password for new account")
@click.option("--role", default="user", type=click.Choice(["user", "admin"]))
def register(username: str, password: str, role: str):
    """Register new user account."""

@auth.command()
def logout():
    """Logout and clear stored credentials."""
```

### API Integration Pattern
```python
class AuthAPIClient(CIDXRemoteAPIClient):
    def login(self, username: str, password: str) -> AuthResponse:
        """Authenticate user and return tokens."""

    def register(self, username: str, password: str, role: str) -> AuthResponse:
        """Register new user and return tokens."""

    def logout(self) -> None:
        """Clear authentication state."""
```

### Credential Storage Security
**Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for credential storage
**Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with user-specific salt
**Storage Location**: `~/.cidx-remote/credentials.enc`
**File Permissions**: 600 (user read/write only)

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Command parameter validation and parsing
- [ ] Interactive credential input handling
- [ ] Credential encryption/decryption operations
- [ ] Error handling for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Authentication state management logic

### Integration Test Coverage
- [ ] End-to-end login workflow with real server
- [ ] Registration workflow with server validation
- [ ] Logout credential cleanup verification
- [ ] Error handling with server error responses
- [ ] Network connectivity failure scenarios

### Security Test Coverage
- [ ] Credential storage encryption validation
- [ ] Password input security (no echo, no logging)
- [ ] Token storage and retrieval security
- [ ] Credential cleanup completeness verification
- [ ] Protection against timing attacks

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets
- Login operation: <3 seconds for successful authentication
- Registration operation: <5 seconds including account creation
- Logout operation: <1 second for credential cleanup
- Interactive prompts: <100ms response time

### Resource Requirements
- Credential storage: <1KB per user
- Memory usage: <10MB additional during authentication operations
- Network traffic: Minimal (only authentication requests)

## Error Handling Specifications

### User-Friendly Error Messages
```
Authentication failed: Invalid username or password
Registration failed: Username already exists
Server connection failed: Unable to reach CIDX server at <url>
Password too weak: Must contain at least 8 characters with numbers and symbols
Network timeout: Server did not respond within 30 seconds
```

### Recovery Guidance
- Invalid credentials: Suggest password reset or username verification
