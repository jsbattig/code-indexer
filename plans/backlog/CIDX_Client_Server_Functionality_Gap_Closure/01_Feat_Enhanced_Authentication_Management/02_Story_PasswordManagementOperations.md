# Story: Password Management Operations

[Conversation Reference: "Password change and reset functionality"]

## Story Overview

**Objective**: Implement secure password management operations including user-initiated password changes and password reset workflows through CLI commands.

**User Value**: Users can securely manage their passwords without requiring administrative intervention, maintaining account security and providing self-service password recovery capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria Summary**: Complete password lifecycle management with change password and reset password functionality, including proper validation and security measures.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Change Password Command Implementation
**Scenario**: Authenticated user changes their password
```gherkin
Given I am authenticated with stored credentials
When I execute "cidx auth change-password"
Then the system should prompt "Current Password:" with hidden input
And I enter my current password
And the system should prompt "New Password:" with hidden input
And I enter my new password
And the system should prompt "Confirm New Password:" with hidden input
And I enter the same new password
And the system should validate the new password meets policy requirements
And send password change request to server
And display "Password changed successfully"
And maintain current authentication session
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement `cidx auth change-password` command with interactive prompts
- [ ] Integrate with PUT `/api/users/change-password` endpoint
- [ ] Validate current password before allowing change
- [ ] Implement password confirmation matching validation
- [ ] Apply password strength policy validation
- [ ] Maintain authentication session after successful password change
- [ ] Use secure password input (no echo) for all password prompts

### AC2: Password Policy Validation
**Scenario**: System enforces password strength requirements
```gherkin
Given I am changing my password
When I enter a password that is too short
Then the system should display "Password too weak: Must be at least 8 characters long"
And prompt for password again

When I enter a password without numbers or symbols
Then the system should display "Password too weak: Must contain numbers and symbols"
And prompt for password again

When I enter a password that meets all requirements
Then the system should accept the password
And proceed with the change request
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement client-side password strength validation
- [ ] Enforce minimum 8 character length requirement
- [ ] Require inclusion of numbers and special characters
- [ ] Provide specific feedback for each policy violation
- [ ] Re-prompt for password until policy requirements are met
- [ ] Validate against server-side password policy as well

### AC3: Password Reset Initiation
**Scenario**: User initiates password reset when unable to login
```gherkin
Given I have CIDX client configured for remote mode
And I cannot authenticate with my current password
When I execute "cidx auth reset-password --username <user>"
Then the system should send reset request to server
And display "Password reset request sent for <user>"
And display "Check your email for reset instructions"
And provide guidance for completing the reset process
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement `cidx auth reset-password` command with username parameter
- [ ] Integrate with POST `/auth/reset-password` endpoint
- [ ] Handle reset request submission without requiring authentication
- [ ] Provide clear instructions for completing reset process
- [ ] Handle cases where username doesn't exist gracefully
- [ ] Support both parameter and interactive username entry

### AC4: Password Confirmation Validation
**Scenario**: System ensures password confirmation matches
```gherkin
Given I am changing my password
When I enter a new password
And I enter a different confirmation password
Then the system should display "Password confirmation does not match"
And prompt for both passwords again
And not submit the password change request

When I enter matching new password and confirmation
Then the system should accept the passwords
And proceed with the change request
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement password confirmation matching validation
- [ ] Clear previous password entries when confirmation fails
- [ ] Re-prompt for both new password and confirmation on mismatch
- [ ] Provide clear feedback when passwords don't match
- [ ] Only proceed to server request when passwords match exactly

### AC5: Authentication Context Handling
**Scenario**: Password operations handle authentication state properly
```gherkin
Given I am not currently authenticated
When I execute "cidx auth change-password"
Then the system should display "Authentication required: Please login first"
And suggest using "cidx auth login" to authenticate
And not prompt for any passwords

Given I am authenticated but my session has expired
When I execute "cidx auth change-password"
Then the system should display "Session expired: Please login again"
And clear stored credentials
And suggest re-authentication
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Validate authentication state before password change operations
- [ ] Check token validity and expiration before proceeding
- [ ] Handle expired sessions gracefully with clear messaging
- [ ] Provide appropriate guidance for authentication requirements
- [ ] Clear invalid credentials when session has expired

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Structure
```python
@auth.command(name="change-password")
def change_password():
    """Change current user password."""
    # Validate authentication state
    # Prompt for current password (hidden)
    # Prompt for new password (hidden)
    # Prompt for password confirmation (hidden)
    # Validate password policy
    # Submit change request
    # Handle response and display result

@auth.command(name="reset-password")
@click.option("--username", "-u", help="Username for password reset")
def reset_password(username: str):
    """Initiate password reset for specified user."""
    # Get username (parameter or interactive)
    # Submit reset request to server
    # Display reset instructions
    # Handle server response
```

### API Integration Pattern
```python
class AuthAPIClient(CIDXRemoteAPIClient):
    def change_password(self, current_password: str, new_password: str) -> ChangePasswordResponse:
        """Change user password with current password validation."""

    def reset_password(self, username: str) -> ResetPasswordResponse:
        """Initiate password reset for specified username."""
```

### Password Policy Implementation
```python
class PasswordPolicy:
    MIN_LENGTH = 8
    REQUIRE_NUMBERS = True
    REQUIRE_SYMBOLS = True

    @staticmethod
    def validate(password: str) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
        """Validate password against policy requirements."""

    @staticmethod
    def get_policy_description() -> str:
        """Return human-readable policy description."""
```

## Security Specifications

### Password Handling Security
**Input Security**: Use `getpass` module to prevent password echoing
**Memory Security**: Clear password variables immediately after use
**Logging Security**: Never log passwords or include in error messages
**Transmission Security**: HTTPS-only for password transmission

### Authentication Validation
**Session Validation**: Verify JWT token validity before password operations
**Token Refresh**: Automatically refresh expired tokens when possible
**Credential Cleanup**: Clear invalid credentials to prevent confusion
**Error Messages**: Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
