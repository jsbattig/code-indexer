- Supports operational decision making
- **Stories**: 3 stories (estimated 8 story points total)

### Phase 4: Administrative Functions (Weeks 7-8)
**Feature 4: Administrative User Management** - **ADMIN CAPABILITIES**
- Requires authentication foundation and role-based access
- Enables complete user lifecycle management for administrators
- **Stories**: 3 stories (estimated 10 story points total)

**Feature 5: Golden Repository Administration** - **ADMIN REPOSITORY MGMT**
- Builds on user management for administrative repository operations
- Completes repository ecosystem management capabilities
- **Stories**: 3 stories (estimated 12 story points total)

## CLI Command Structure Overview

### New Command Groups Added
```bash
# Enhanced Authentication (Feature 1)
cidx auth login/register/logout/status/change-password/reset-password

# Repository Management (Feature 2)
cidx repos list/available/discover/activate/deactivate/info/switch-branch/sync

# Job Control (Feature 3)
cidx jobs list/status/cancel/history/cleanup

# Administrative User Management (Feature 4)
cidx admin users list/create/update/delete/reset-password/show

# Administrative Repository Management (Feature 5)
cidx admin repos list/add/refresh/delete/status/maintenance

# System Health Monitoring (Feature 6)
cidx system health/status/diagnostics/services/metrics
```

### Existing Commands Enhanced
- `cidx sync` - Enhanced with repository context awareness (Feature 2)
- Backward compatibility maintained for all existing functionality

## API Endpoint Coverage

### Complete Server Endpoint Implementation
**Authentication Endpoints**:
- POST `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/reset-password`
- PUT `/api/users/change-password`

**User Repository Endpoints**:
- GET `/api/repos`, `/api/repos/available`, `/api/repos/discover`
- POST `/api/repos/activate`
- DELETE `/api/repos/{user_alias}`
- GET `/api/repos/{user_alias}`
- PUT `/api/repos/{user_alias}/branch`

**Job Management Endpoints**:
- GET `/api/jobs`, `/api/jobs/{job_id}`
- DELETE `/api/jobs/{job_id}`, `/api/admin/jobs/cleanup`

**Administrative User Endpoints**:
- GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/admin/users/{username}`

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### API Client Architecture
```python
# Base client with authentication and common functionality
CIDXRemoteAPIClient (existing)

# Specialized clients for each domain
├── AuthAPIClient (Feature 1)
├── ReposAPIClient (Feature 2)
├── JobsAPIClient (Feature 3)
├── AdminAPIClient (Features 4 & 5)
└── SystemAPIClient (Feature 6)
```

### Integration Patterns
- **Mode Detection**: All new commands use `@require_mode("remote")` decorator
- **Authentication**: JWT token management with encrypted credential storage
- **Progress Reporting**: Consistent with existing CLI progress patterns
