# Feature: Golden Repository Administration

[Conversation Reference: "Golden repository addition from Git URLs, repository refresh and re-indexing, repository deletion and cleanup, golden repository listing and status"]

## Feature Overview

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive golden repository administration capabilities through CLI commands, enabling administrators to manage the master repository collection that users can activate.

**Business Value**: Enables administrators to manage the central repository collection, add new repositories from Git sources, maintain indexes, and ensure repository availability for user activation.

**Priority**: 5 (Administrative capability building on user management foundation)

## Technical Architecture

### Command Structure Extension
```
cidx admin repos
├── list           # List all golden repositories with status
├── add            # Add new repository from Git URL
├── refresh        # Refresh and re-index existing repositories
├── delete         # Delete golden repository with cleanup
├── status         # Show repository health and usage statistics
└── maintenance    # Repository maintenance and optimization
```

### API Integration Points
