# Feature: Repository Management Fixes

## Feature Overview
This feature addresses critical failures in repository management operations, specifically the HTTP 500 "broken pipe" error during deletion and implements missing endpoints for repository details and synchronization.

## Problem Statement
- Repository deletion fails with HTTP 500 error and broken pipe messages
- Missing GET /api/repositories/{repo_id} endpoint for repository details
- Missing POST /api/repositories/{repo_id}/sync endpoint for manual synchronization
- Resource cleanup issues causing file handle leaks
- Database transaction management problems during deletion

## Technical Architecture

### Affected Components
```
Repository API Layer
├── DELETE /api/repositories/{repo_id} [BROKEN]
├── GET /api/repositories/{repo_id} [MISSING]
├── POST /api/repositories/{repo_id}/sync [MISSING]
└── Error Handling [INADEQUATE]

Repository Service Layer
├── delete_repository() [FAULTY]
├── get_repository_details() [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
├── sync_repository() [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
└── Resource Management [LEAKING]
```

### Design Decisions
1. **Transaction Management**: Wrap all delete operations in proper database transactions
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Implement try-finally blocks for all file operations
3. **Async Operations**: Use BackgroundTasks for long-running sync operations
4. **Error Recovery**: Add rollback mechanisms for partial failures
5. **Status Reporting**: Implement progress callbacks for sync operations

## Dependencies
- FastAPI framework for API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy for database transactions
- Qdrant client for vector database operations
- GitPython for repository operations
- Background task queue for async operations

## Story List

1. **01_Story_Fix_Repository_Deletion_Error** - Fix HTTP 500 broken pipe error during deletion
2. **02_Story_Implement_Repository_Details_Endpoint** - Add GET endpoint for repository details
3. **03_Story_Implement_Repository_Sync_Endpoint** - Add POST endpoint for manual sync
4. **04_Story_Add_Repository_Resource_Cleanup** - Ensure proper resource management

## Integration Points
- Database layer for transactional operations
- File system for repository data cleanup
- Qdrant for vector embedding deletion
- Background job system for async operations
- Logging system for error tracking

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each service method
- Integration tests for database transactions
- E2E tests for complete deletion flow
- Performance tests for large repository handling
- Stress tests for concurrent operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Repository deletion completes without HTTP 500 errors
- [ ] All file handles properly closed after operations
- [ ] Database transactions commit or rollback atomically
- [ ] GET /api/repositories/{repo_id} returns repository details
- [ ] POST /api/repositories/{repo_id}/sync triggers synchronization
- [ ] Manual test case TC_REPO_004 passes successfully
- [ ] No resource leaks detected under load testing

## Risk Considerations
- **Data Loss**: Ensure deletion is reversible until fully committed
- **Concurrent Access**: Handle multiple users accessing same repository
- **Large Repositories**: Manage memory for repositories with many files
- **Network Failures**: Handle disconnections during long operations

## Performance Requirements
- Repository deletion < 5 seconds for repositories under 1000 files
- Details endpoint response time < 200ms
- Sync initiation response time < 500ms
- No memory leaks after 100 consecutive operations
