# Story: Multi-Platform Instruction Convention Research

## Story Overview

### User Story
As a developer implementing the teach-ai feature, I want to research how each AI coding platform (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Q, Junie) expects to receive instruction files so that I can design accurate platform-specific instruction generation.

### Value Delivered
Working research documentation that enables accurate implementation of platform-specific instruction generation without guesswork or trial-and-error.

### Story Points Indicators
- üîç Research-heavy story (no code implementation)
- üìä 6 platforms to investigate
- üìÅ Deliverable is documentation, not code

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)

Feature: Multi-Platform Instruction Convention Research

Scenario: Research platform instruction conventions
  Given I need to implement teach-ai for 6 AI platforms
  When I research each platform's instruction file conventions
  Then I document the following for each platform:
    | Aspect                      | Required Information                          |
    | Global directory location   | ~/.claude/, ~/.codex/, etc.                 |
    | File naming convention      | CLAUDE.md, .codex.json, etc.                |
    | Format requirements         | Markdown, JSON, YAML                        |
    | Platform-specific syntax    | Special conventions or requirements          |
    | Example files              | From official documentation                  |

Scenario: Compile research into implementation guide
  Given the research is complete
  When I compile the findings into an implementation guide
  Then the guide contains:
    | Section                    | Content                                       |
    | Comparison table          | Platform-by-platform feature matrix           |
    | File specifications       | Exact paths and naming for each platform      |
    | Format requirements       | Detailed format specs per platform            |
    | Example structures        | Sample instruction files                      |
    | Recommendations          | Implementation approach suggestions            |

Scenario: Enable accurate implementation
  Given the implementation guide is created
  When other stories reference platform-specific conventions
  Then developers have authoritative source for accurate implementation
  And no guesswork is required for file locations or formats
```
