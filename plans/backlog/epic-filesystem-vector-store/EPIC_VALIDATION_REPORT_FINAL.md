## CONVERSATION COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

**Conversation Context Analysis:**
The epic correctly implements the 9 user stories discussed in conversation:

1. **Story 0 (POC):** User explicitly requested: "I want you to add one user story, story zero... doing a proof of concept... fine tune with this the approach"
   - ✅ Story 00_Story_POCPathQuantization.md fully addresses POC requirements

2. **Container-Free Operation:** User stated: "I don't want to run ANY containers, zero"
   - ✅ All stories operate without Docker/Podman containers
   - ✅ Filesystem backend eliminates container dependencies

3. **Git-Trackable Storage:** User requested: "I want to store my index, side by side, with my code, and I want it to go inside git"
   - ✅ Story 2 implements `.code-indexer/vectors/` git-trackable JSON storage

4. **Path-as-Vector Quantization:** User proposed: "can't you lay, on disk, json files that represent the metadata related to the vector, and the entire path IS the vector?"
   - ✅ Story 2 implements complete quantization pipeline (1536→64 dims→2-bit→path)

5. **No Chunk Text Storage:** User specified: "no chunk data is stored in the json objects, but relative references to the files"
   - ✅ Story 2 explicitly stores only file references (no chunk text duplication)

6. **RAM-Based Ranking:** User confirmed: "can't you fetch and sort in RAM by rank? It's OK to fetch all, sort and return"
   - ✅ Story 3 implements fetch-all-and-rank-in-RAM approach

7. **Performance Target:** User stated: "~1s is fine" for 40K vectors
   - ✅ All stories target <1s query performance for 40K vectors

8. **Backend Abstraction:** User requested: "abstract the qdrant db provider behind an abstraction layer... drop it in based on a --flag"
   - ✅ Story 1 implements VectorStoreBackend abstraction with `--vector-store` flag

9. **No Migration Tools:** User decided: "I don't want any migration tools, to use this new system, we will destroy, re-init and reindex"
   - ✅ Story 8 implements clean-slate switching without migration

**MISSING REQUIREMENTS:** None identified

**UNAUTHORIZED ADDITIONS:** None identified

**SPECIFICATION DEVIATIONS:** None identified

## COMPLETENESS GAPS

**Incomplete Feature Coverage:** None - all stories have corresponding files
