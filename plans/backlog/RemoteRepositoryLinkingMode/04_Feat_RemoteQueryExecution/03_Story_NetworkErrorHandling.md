# User Story: Network Error Handling

## 📋 **User Story**

As a **CIDX user**, I want **graceful handling of network failures with clear guidance**, so that **I understand connectivity issues and know how to resolve them**.

## 🎯 **Business Value**

Provides robust remote operation with helpful error recovery guidance. Users can diagnose and resolve connectivity issues effectively.

## 📝 **Acceptance Criteria**

### Given: Network Failure Detection
**When** network connectivity issues occur during queries  
**Then** system detects different types of network failures  
**And** provides specific error messages for each failure type  
**And** suggests appropriate troubleshooting steps  
**And** avoids generic unhelpful error messages  

### Given: Graceful Degradation
**When** remote server becomes unreachable  
**Then** system fails gracefully without crashes  
**And** provides clear indication of connectivity issues  
**And** suggests checking network connection and server status  
**And** preserves local configuration for recovery  

### Given: Retry Logic Implementation
**When** transient network errors occur  
**Then** system implements appropriate exponential backoff retry  
**And** distinguishes permanent failures from transient issues  
**And** provides progress indication during retries  
**And** respects reasonable timeout limits  

## 📊 **Definition of Done**

- ✅ Network error classification and specific error messages
- ✅ Exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures
- ✅ Timeout handling with user-friendly feedback
- ✅ Integration with API client error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with network simulation
- ✅ User guidance for common connectivity issues
- ✅ Error recovery without losing user context
- ✅ Performance validation under poor network conditions
