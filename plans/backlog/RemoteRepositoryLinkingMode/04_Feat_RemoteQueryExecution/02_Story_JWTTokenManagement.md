# User Story: JWT Token Management

## 📋 **User Story**

As a **CIDX user**, I want **automatic JWT token refresh and re-authentication**, so that **my queries never fail due to token expiration without transparent recovery**.

## 🎯 **Business Value**

Eliminates user friction from authentication failures. Provides seamless long-running session support without interrupting user workflow.

## 📝 **Acceptance Criteria**

### Given: Automatic Token Refresh
**When** my JWT token expires during normal operation  
**Then** the system automatically refreshes the token  
**And** continues the original operation without user intervention  
**And** no error messages about token expiration appear  
**And** query execution completes successfully  

### Given: Re-authentication Fallback
**When** token refresh fails or server requires re-authentication  
**Then** system automatically re-authenticates using stored credentials  
**And** obtains new JWT token transparently  
**And** retries the original operation  
**And** provides success feedback without exposing authentication details  

### Given: Token Lifecycle Management
**When** I use remote mode over extended periods  
**Then** token management happens entirely within API client layer  
**And** business logic never handles authentication concerns  
**And** multiple concurrent operations share token state safely  
**And** token validation prevents unnecessary authentication calls  

## 📊 **Definition of Done**

- ✅ Automatic JWT token refresh before expiration
- ✅ Re-authentication fallback on refresh failures
- ✅ Thread-safe token management for concurrent operations
- ✅ Integration with CIDXRemoteAPIClient base class
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for authentication failures
- ✅ Performance testing with long-running sessions
- ✅ Unit testing with token expiration scenarios
- ✅ User experience validation with no authentication interruptions
