# User Story: Credential Rotation Support

## 📋 **User Story**

As a **CIDX user**, I want **ability to update my remote credentials while preserving repository configuration**, so that **I can change passwords without losing remote repository links and settings**.

## 🎯 **Business Value**

Enables secure credential lifecycle management without disrupting established remote workflows. Users can maintain security hygiene without reconfiguration overhead.

## 📝 **Acceptance Criteria**

### Given: Credential Update Command
**When** I run `cidx auth update` in remote mode  
**Then** system prompts for new username and password  
**And** validates new credentials with remote server before storage  
**And** preserves existing remote configuration and repository links  
**And** provides confirmation of successful credential update  

### Given: Configuration Preservation
**When** I update credentials  
**Then** server URL and repository link remain unchanged  
**And** user preferences and settings are preserved  
**And** only authentication information is updated  
**And** rollback available if credential update fails
