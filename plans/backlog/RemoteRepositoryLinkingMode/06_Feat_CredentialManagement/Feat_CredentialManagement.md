# Feature: Credential Management

## ðŸŽ¯ **Feature Overview**

Implement comprehensive credential lifecycle management with secure token handling, credential rotation support, and multi-project isolation.

## âœ… **Acceptance Criteria**

### Secure Token Lifecycle Management
- âœ… JWT token management within API client abstraction
- âœ… Automatic refresh and re-authentication flows
- âœ… Thread-safe token operations for concurrent requests
- âœ… Secure memory handling for token data

### Credential Rotation Support
- âœ… `cidx auth update` command for password changes
- âœ… Preserve remote configuration during credential updates
- âœ… Validation of new credentials before storage
- âœ… Rollback capability if credential update fails

### Multi-Project Credential Isolation
- âœ… Project-specific credential encryption and storage
- âœ… Prevention of cross-project credential reuse
- âœ… Independent credential lifecycles per project
- âœ… Secure cleanup when projects are removed

## ðŸ“Š **Stories**
1. **Secure Token Lifecycle**: JWT management within API abstraction
2. **Credential Rotation Support**: Password update with configuration preservation
3. **Multi-Project Credential Isolation**: Independent credential management per project
