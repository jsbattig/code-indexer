# Epic Organization Summary

## Overview
All planning documents have been reorganized according to the Epic Writing Standards defined in `/home/jsbattig/.claude/epic-writing-standards.md`. The new structure provides clear categorization of epics by status and follows consistent naming conventions.

## New Directory Structure

/plans/backlog/
├── Active/         # Currently in-progress epics
├── Backlog/        # Planned but not started epics
└── Completed/      # Finished epics
```

## Naming Convention Standards

All new epics follow this structure:

```
/plans/backlog/{Status}/{EpicName}/
├── Epic_{Name}.md
├── 01_Feat_{FeatureName}/
│   ├── Feat_{FeatureName}.md
│   ├── 01_Story_{StoryName}.md
│   ├── 02_Story_{StoryName}.md
│   └── 03_Story_{StoryName}.md
└── 02_Feat_{FeatureName}/
    ├── Feat_{FeatureName}.md
    └── 01_Story_{StoryName}.md
```

## Migration Actions Completed

1. **Created new directory structure**: Active/, Backlog/, Completed/
2. **Moved CIDXRepositorySync**: From `/epics/` to `/plans/backlog/Completed/`
   - Renamed all stories to follow 01_Story_, 02_Story_ convention
   - Maintained all 6 features with proper numbering
3. **Moved RemoteRepositoryLinkingMode**: To Completed/ folder
   - Integrated manual testing documents as ManualTesting/ subdirectory
4. **Moved CIDXServerCriticalIssuesResolution**: To Completed/ folder
   - Renamed from CIDX_Server_Critical_Issues_Resolution
5. **Consolidated historical epics**: From `/dev/planning/backlog/Completed/`
6. **Removed old directories**:
   - `/epics/` - Deleted
   - `/dev/planning/` - Deleted

## Benefits of New Organization

- **Clear Status Tracking**: Instantly see what's active, planned, or completed
- **Consistent Structure**: All epics follow the same naming patterns
- **Easy Navigation**: Hierarchical organization makes finding content simple
- **Integration Ready**: Works with implement-epic command workflow
- **Historical Preservation**: All past work maintained in Completed folder

## Next Steps

For any new epics:
1. Create in `/plans/backlog/Backlog/` when planning
2. Move to `/plans/backlog/Active/` when starting work
3. Move to `/plans/backlog/Completed/` when finished
4. Always follow the Epic_/Feat_/Story_ naming convention
5. Use sequential numbering (01_, 02_, 03_) for ordering
