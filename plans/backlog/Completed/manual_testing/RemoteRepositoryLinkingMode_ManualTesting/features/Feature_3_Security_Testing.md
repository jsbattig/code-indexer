# Feature 3: Security Testing

## ðŸŽ¯ **Feature Intent**

Validate comprehensive security controls for Remote Repository Linking Mode including credential encryption, JWT token lifecycle, multi-project isolation, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.

## ðŸ“‹ **Feature Summary**

This feature encompasses thorough security testing of credential management, authentication flows, and data isolation. Testing validates PBKDF2 encryption implementation, JWT token security, credential rotation workflows, and ensures no credential leakage across projects or in system logs.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Acceptance Criteria**

### Encryption Requirements
- âœ… PBKDF2 with minimum 100,000 iterations
- âœ… Unique salt per project (minimum 16 bytes)
- âœ… Credentials encrypted at rest and in transit
- âœ… Configuration files with 600 permissions

### Authentication Requirements
- âœ… JWT tokens with appropriate expiration (10-30 minutes)
- âœ… Automatic token refresh before expiration
- âœ… Secure token storage in memory only
- âœ… Re-authentication on token expiration

### Isolation Requirements
- âœ… Complete credential isolation between projects
- âœ… No credential sharing via environment variables
- âœ… Project-specific key derivation
- âœ… No plaintext credentials in logs or dumps
