# Feature 12: Sync Job Monitoring and Progress Tracking

## üéØ **Feature Intent**

Validate sync job monitoring functionality to ensure users can track repository synchronization progress and manage long-running sync operations effectively.

[Manual Testing Reference: "Sync job lifecycle and progress monitoring"]

## üìã **Feature Description**

**As a** Developer using remote CIDX
**I want to** monitor sync job progress and status
**So that** I can track long-running sync operations and manage job execution

[Conversation Reference: "Background job tracking for sync operations"]

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

The sync job monitoring system provides:
- Real-time job progress tracking through polling
- Job lifecycle management (queued, running, completed, failed)
- Background job execution with timeout management
- Progress reporting through callback mechanisms
- Job status APIs for monitoring and cancellation

**Key Components**:
- `SyncJobManager` - Job lifecycle and persistence management
- `JobPollingEngine` - Real-time progress tracking with callbacks
- Background job execution with thread safety
- Job status APIs (`/api/jobs/{job_id}`, `/api/jobs`)
- Resource monitoring and concurrent job limits

## üîß **Core Requirements**

1. **Job Tracking**: Monitor sync jobs from submission to completion
2. **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates during sync operations
3. **Job Management**: List, query, and manage running sync jobs
4. **Resource Control**: Manage concurrent job limits and resource usage
5. **Error Handling**: Proper job failure tracking and recovery

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- Job APIs exist but are not exposed through CLI commands
- Jobs include both git operations and full indexing phases
- Polling engine provides real-time progress updates
- Job management includes automatic cleanup and retention

## üìã **Stories Breakdown**

### Story 12.1: Sync Job Submission and Tracking
- **Goal**: Validate job submission and basic tracking functionality
- **Scope**: Submit sync jobs and monitor their execution status

### Story 12.2: Real-time Progress Monitoring
- **Goal**: Test real-time progress updates during sync operations
- **Scope**: Monitor job progress through polling mechanism and callbacks

### Story 12.3: Job Management Operations
- **Goal**: Validate job listing, querying, and management capabilities
- **Scope**: Test job APIs for monitoring and operational management
