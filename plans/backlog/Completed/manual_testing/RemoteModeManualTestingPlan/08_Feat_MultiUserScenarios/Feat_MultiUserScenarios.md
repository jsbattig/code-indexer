# Feature 10: Multi-User Scenarios

## 🎯 **Feature Intent**

Test concurrent usage patterns to ensure multiple users can effectively share remote CIDX resources without conflicts and with proper isolation.

[Conversation Reference: "10_Feat_MultiUserScenarios: Concurrent usage patterns"]

## 📋 **Feature Summary**

This feature validates CIDX's ability to handle multiple concurrent users in remote mode, ensuring that team collaboration scenarios work effectively without user conflicts. Testing focuses on concurrent operations, resource sharing, and proper user isolation.

## 🔧 **Implementation Stories**

### Story 10.1: Concurrent Usage Testing
**Priority**: Low - advanced use case validation
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Multiple users can query simultaneously without conflicts
- Concurrent authentication and token management works correctly
- System performance degrades gracefully under multi-user load

### Story 10.2: Multi-User Validation
**Priority**: Low - team collaboration scenarios
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User isolation prevents credential leakage between sessions
- Shared repositories are accessible to authorized users
- Multi-user operations maintain data consistency

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Concurrent Capacity**: Support for multiple simultaneous users
- **Performance Degradation**: <20% performance reduction per concurrent user
- **User Isolation**: Zero credential or session leakage between users
- **Resource Sharing**: Proper access control for shared resources
