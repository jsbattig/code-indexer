# Story 10.2: Session Isolation Validation

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate user session isolation and data separation in multi-user remote environments through systematic manual testing procedures.

[Conversation Reference: "Session isolation validation"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Security-Conscious Developer
**I want to** ensure that user sessions are completely isolated from each other
**So that** sensitive repository access and user data remain secure in shared environments

[Conversation Reference: "Each test story specifies exact python -m code_indexer.cli commands to execute"]

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 10.2.1: Configuration Isolation Testing
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# User 1: Configure specific settings
python -m code_indexer.cli init --remote https://server.example.com --username user1 --password pass1
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "user1-private-repo"
# User 2 (different session): Different configuration
python -m code_indexer.cli init --remote https://server.example.com --username user2 --password pass2
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "user2-private-repo"
# Verify isolation
python -m code_indexer.cli query "user specific test" --limit 3  # Each user in their session
```

**Expected Results:**
- Each user's configuration completely separate and isolated
- User 1 queries only user1-private-repo content
- User 2 queries only user2-private-repo content
- No configuration bleed-through between user sessions

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Complete configuration isolation with no cross-user access
- ‚ùå FAIL: Configuration sharing or cross-user repository access

### Test 10.2.2: Authentication Token Isolation
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# User 1: Establish authentication
python -m code_indexer.cli auth-status  # Should show user1 authentication
# User 2 (different session): Establish different authentication
python -m code_indexer.cli auth-status  # Should show user2 authentication
# User 1: Verify authentication unchanged
python -m code_indexer.cli auth-status  # Should still show user1 authentication
```

**Expected Results:**
- Each user maintains independent authentication tokens
- Authentication token changes don't affect other users
- Token expiration and refresh isolated per user
- Authentication status accurate for each user session

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Authentication tokens completely isolated per user session
- ‚ùå FAIL: Authentication token sharing or cross-contamination

### Test 10.2.3: Query History Isolation
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# User 1: Execute specific queries
python -m code_indexer.cli query "user1 specific search" --limit 5
python -m code_indexer.cli query "user1 private function" --limit 3
# User 2: Execute different queries
python -m code_indexer.cli query "user2 specific search" --limit 5
python -m code_indexer.cli query "user2 private function" --limit 3
# Verify query history isolation (if available)
python -m code_indexer.cli query-history  # Should show only relevant user's queries
```

**Expected Results:**
- Query history (if maintained) separate per user
- No visibility into other users' query patterns
- Query caching (if any) doesn't leak between users
- Each user sees only their own query activity

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Query history and activity completely isolated per user
- ‚ùå FAIL: Query history sharing or visibility into other users' activities

### Test 10.2.4: Session State Persistence
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# User 1: Establish state and disconnect
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "repo-alpha"
python -m code_indexer.cli switch-branch feature-branch
# Simulate session disconnect/reconnect
# User 1: Reconnect and verify state
python -m code_indexer.cli link-status
python -m code_indexer.cli branch-status
# User 2: Different session state
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "repo-beta"
python -m code_indexer.cli switch-branch main
```

**Expected Results:**
- User 1 session state persists correctly across disconnection
- User 2 maintains completely different session state
- No session state cross-contamination
- Each user's context restored correctly on reconnection

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Session state persistence isolated and accurate per user
- ‚ùå FAIL: Session state sharing or incorrect state restoration

### Test 10.2.5: Resource Access Control Validation
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# User 1: Access authorized repository
python -m code_indexer.cli query "authorized content search" --limit 5
# User 2: Attempt to access User 1's repository (should fail)
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "user1-private-repo"  # Should be denied or fail
# User 2: Access own authorized repository
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "user2-private-repo"
python -m code_indexer.cli query "user2 authorized content" --limit 5
```

**Expected Results:**
- User 1 successfully accesses authorized repositories
- User 2 cannot access User 1's private repositories
- User 2 can access own authorized repositories
- Access control enforced at session level

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Access control properly enforced with no unauthorized repository access
- ‚ùå FAIL: Unauthorized access to other users' repositories or resources

### Test 10.2.6: Concurrent Session Modification Isolation
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# User 1 and User 2: Modify session settings simultaneously
# User 1:
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "repo-alpha"
python -m code_indexer.cli switch-branch feature-1
# User 2 (simultaneously):
python -m code_indexer.cli link-repository "repo-beta"
python -m code_indexer.cli switch-branch feature-2
# Both users: Verify their settings remain correct
python -m code_indexer.cli link-status && python -m code_indexer.cli branch-status
```

**Expected Results:**
- Concurrent session modifications don't interfere
- Each user's session changes apply only to their session
- No race conditions or state corruption between users
- Session modifications isolated despite concurrent timing

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Concurrent session modifications completely isolated
- ‚ùå FAIL: Session modification interference or state corruption

### Test 10.2.7: Credential Security Validation
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# User 1: Check credential storage
ls -la ~/.code-indexer/  # Verify credential file permissions
# User 2: Different credential storage
ls -la ~/.code-indexer/  # Should be different or inaccessible
# Cross-user credential access test
sudo -u user2 cat /home/user1/.code-indexer/.remote-config  # Should fail
```

**Expected Results:**
- Credential files properly secured per user
- No cross-user access to credential storage
- File permissions prevent unauthorized credential access
- Each user's credentials completely isolated

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Credential storage secured with proper isolation and permissions
- ‚ùå FAIL: Cross-user credential access or inadequate security

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Isolation Completeness**: 100% session isolation with no cross-user data access
- **Security Compliance**: All credential and configuration data properly secured
- **State Integrity**: User session states maintained accurately across all operations
- **Access Control**: Authorization properly enforced at user session level

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- Multiple user accounts with different privileges/access
- Ability to run sessions as different system users
- Test repositories with different access controls
- File system access for credential security testing

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Create multiple user accounts with different access levels
2. Set up repositories with different permission levels
3. Prepare credential security testing with file permissions
4. Ensure ability to simulate different user sessions simultaneously

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. Verify no residual cross-user data or configuration
2. Confirm credential files properly secured and isolated
3. Test that session isolation persists after testing
4. Document any security considerations or isolation gaps discovered
