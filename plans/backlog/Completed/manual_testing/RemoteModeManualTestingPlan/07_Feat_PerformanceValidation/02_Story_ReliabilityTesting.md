# Story 9.2: Reliability Testing

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate remote operation reliability and stability under various conditions through systematic manual testing procedures.

[Conversation Reference: "Reliability testing"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Developer
**I want to** verify that remote CIDX operations are reliable and stable
**So that** I can depend on remote functionality for consistent development workflow

[Conversation Reference: "Each test story specifies exact python -m code_indexer.cli commands to execute"]

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 9.2.1: Extended Operation Reliability
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Run continuous queries for extended period
for i in {1..50}; do
  echo "Query $i of 50"
  python -m code_indexer.cli query "function definition query $i" --limit 5
  sleep 2
done
```

**Expected Results:**
- All 50 queries complete successfully without failures
- Consistent response times throughout extended operation
- No memory leaks or resource accumulation over time
- Connection stability maintained across all operations

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: All queries succeed with consistent performance and no resource issues
- ‚ùå FAIL: Query failures, performance degradation, or resource accumulation

[Conversation Reference: "Clear pass/fail criteria for manual verification"]

### Test 9.2.2: Recovery After Server Restart
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test before, during, and after server restart
python -m code_indexer.cli query "before server restart" --limit 3
# (Server restart occurs here)
sleep 5
python -m code_indexer.cli query "after server restart" --limit 3
```

**Expected Results:**
- First query succeeds normally before server restart
- Query during server unavailability fails with clear error message
- First query after server restart succeeds (automatic reconnection)
- No configuration corruption or persistent issues after server recovery

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Clean recovery after server restart with automatic reconnection
- ‚ùå FAIL: Persistent issues after server recovery or poor error handling

### Test 9.2.3: Connection Persistence Under Load
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Simulate heavy usage with rapid concurrent queries
for i in {1..10}; do
  python -m code_indexer.cli query "load test query batch $i" --limit 2 &
done
wait
```

**Expected Results:**
- All concurrent queries complete successfully
- Connection management handles concurrent load efficiently
- No connection pool exhaustion or resource contention
- Consistent performance across all concurrent operations

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: All concurrent queries succeed with stable connection management
- ‚ùå FAIL: Connection failures, resource exhaustion, or performance collapse

### Test 9.2.4: Authentication Token Reliability
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test operations spanning token refresh period
python -m code_indexer.cli query "token reliability test 1" --limit 5
sleep 60  # Wait for potential token expiration
python -m code_indexer.cli query "token reliability test 2" --limit 5
```

**Expected Results:**
- Both queries succeed regardless of token expiration timing
- Automatic token refresh occurs seamlessly if needed
- No authentication interruptions during normal operation
- Token management transparent to user operations

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Authentication token management completely transparent and reliable
- ‚ùå FAIL: Authentication interruptions or token refresh failures

### Test 9.2.5: Data Consistency Reliability
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test same query multiple times for consistent results
python -m code_indexer.cli query "data consistency test query" --limit 10
python -m code_indexer.cli query "data consistency test query" --limit 10
python -m code_indexer.cli query "data consistency test query" --limit 10
```

**Expected Results:**
- Identical queries return identical results across executions
- Result ordering and content consistent between executions
- No random variations in semantic search results
- Cache behavior (if any) doesn't affect result consistency

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Query results completely consistent across multiple executions
- ‚ùå FAIL: Result variations between identical query executions

### Test 9.2.6: Resource Cleanup Reliability
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Monitor resource usage before, during, and after operations
pidstat -r -p $(pgrep cidx) 1 10 &
for i in {1..20}; do
  python -m code_indexer.cli query "resource cleanup test $i" --limit 8
done
# Check final resource usage
```

**Expected Results:**
- Memory usage remains stable throughout operation sequence
- No memory leaks or resource accumulation over multiple operations
- Process resource consumption returns to baseline after operations
- CPU and memory usage patterns appropriate for workload

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Resource usage stable with proper cleanup after operations
- ‚ùå FAIL: Resource leaks, accumulation, or excessive consumption

### Test 9.2.7: Error Recovery Reliability
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
# Test recovery from various error conditions
python -m code_indexer.cli query "error recovery test" --limit 5  # Normal operation
python -m code_indexer.cli query "nonexistent-function-xyz" --limit 5  # No results
python -m code_indexer.cli query "" --limit 5  # Invalid query
python -m code_indexer.cli query "error recovery test" --limit 5  # Return to normal
```

**Expected Results:**
- Normal operations succeed before and after error conditions
- Error conditions handled gracefully without state corruption
- Recovery to normal operation complete and reliable
- No persistent issues from previous error conditions

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Complete recovery to normal operation after various error conditions
- ‚ùå FAIL: Persistent issues or state corruption from error conditions

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Operation Success Rate**: 99%+ success rate for normal operations
- **Recovery Time**: Full recovery within 10 seconds after failures
- **Resource Stability**: No memory leaks or resource accumulation
- **Consistency**: 100% consistent results for identical queries

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- CIDX remote mode configured and baseline functional
- Ability to restart server for recovery testing
- Process monitoring tools for resource usage tracking
- Extended time availability for long-running reliability tests

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Establish baseline resource usage and performance metrics
2. Prepare server restart capability and monitoring
3. Set up process monitoring for resource usage tracking
4. Plan extended testing periods for reliability validation

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. Verify resource usage returns to baseline levels
2. Confirm no persistent configuration or state issues
3. Test normal operations work correctly after reliability testing
4. Document any reliability patterns or issues discovered
