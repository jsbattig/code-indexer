# Feature 10: Credential Rotation System

## 🎯 **Feature Intent**

Validate credential rotation functionality to ensure users can update their authentication credentials without losing repository configuration or project settings.

[Manual Testing Reference: "Credential rotation and security management"]

## 📋 **Feature Description**

**As a** Developer using remote CIDX
**I want to** update my username and password credentials
**So that** I can maintain access when credentials change without reconfiguring projects

[Conversation Reference: "Secure credential updates while preserving configuration"]

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

The credential rotation system provides:
- Secure credential backup and rollback mechanism
- Server validation before credential storage
- Atomic configuration updates
- Memory security with sensitive data cleanup
- Token invalidation to force re-authentication

**Key Components**:
- `CredentialRotationManager` - Core rotation logic with backup/rollback
- `cidx auth update` - CLI command for credential updates
- Server validation against authentication endpoints
- Encrypted credential storage with project isolation

## 🔧 **Core Requirements**

1. **Secure Rotation**: Update credentials with backup/rollback protection
2. **Server Validation**: Test new credentials before storing them
3. **Configuration Preservation**: Maintain all repository links and project settings
4. **Memory Security**: Secure cleanup of sensitive data from memory
5. **Token Management**: Invalidate cached tokens after credential changes

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Credential validation bug exists** - Current implementation may fail to validate working credentials
- Requires network access to CIDX server for validation
- Changes affect all projects using the same server credentials
- Backup files are created automatically for recovery

## 📋 **Stories Breakdown**

### Story 10.1: Basic Credential Update Operations
- **Goal**: Validate credential update process with proper validation
- **Scope**: Update username/password with server validation

### Story 10.2: Error Handling and Recovery
- **Goal**: Test credential rotation error scenarios and rollback
- **Scope**: Invalid credentials, network failures, rollback mechanisms

### Story 10.3: Configuration Preservation Validation
- **Goal**: Verify repository links and settings survive credential changes
- **Scope**: Ensure no project configuration lost during rotation
