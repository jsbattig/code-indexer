# Feature 11: Project Data Cleanup Operations

## üéØ **Feature Intent**

Validate project data cleanup functionality to ensure users can efficiently clean project data across single or multiple projects without stopping containers.

[Manual Testing Reference: "Project data cleanup and multi-project management"]

## üìã **Feature Description**

**As a** Developer using CIDX
**I want to** clean project data without stopping containers
**So that** I can quickly reset project state and switch between projects efficiently

[Conversation Reference: "Fast project cleanup for test cycles and project switching"]

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

The project cleanup system provides:
- Fast data cleanup while keeping containers running
- Multi-project data clearing capabilities
- Qdrant collection reset operations
- Local cache directory cleanup
- Container state preservation for performance

**Key Components**:
- `cidx clean-data` - CLI command for project data cleanup
- `--all-projects` - Multi-project cleanup functionality
- Container-aware cleanup with Docker/Podman support
- Verification options for cleanup validation

## üîß **Core Requirements**

1. **Fast Cleanup**: Clear project data without container restarts
2. **Multi-Project Support**: Clean data across multiple projects simultaneously
3. **Container Preservation**: Maintain running containers for fast restart
4. **Verification**: Optional validation that cleanup operations succeeded
5. **Selective Targeting**: Support for specific container types (Docker/Podman)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- Much faster than full `uninstall` since containers stay running
- Perfect for test cleanup and project switching scenarios
- Affects Qdrant collections and local cache, not repository content
- Supports both single project and multi-project cleanup modes

## üìã **Stories Breakdown**

### Story 11.1: Single Project Data Cleanup
- **Goal**: Validate cleanup of current project data while preserving containers
- **Scope**: Clear local caches and Qdrant collections for current project

### Story 11.2: Multi-Project Data Cleanup
- **Goal**: Test cleanup across multiple projects simultaneously
- **Scope**: Use `--all-projects` flag to clean data across project boundaries

### Story 11.3: Container Type Specific Cleanup
- **Goal**: Validate cleanup targeting specific container types
- **Scope**: Test Docker/Podman specific cleanup and dual-container scenarios
