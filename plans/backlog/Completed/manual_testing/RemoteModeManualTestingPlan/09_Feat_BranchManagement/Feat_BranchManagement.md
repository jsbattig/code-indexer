# Feature 9: Branch Management Operations

## üéØ **Feature Intent**

Validate branch management functionality in remote mode to ensure users can list available branches and switch between them for different development contexts.

[Manual Testing Reference: "Branch operations in remote mode"]

## üìã **Feature Description**

**As a** Developer using remote CIDX
**I want to** manage repository branches (list and switch)
**So that** I can work with different branches for feature development

[Conversation Reference: "Branch listing and switching functionality"]

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

The branch management system provides:
- Branch listing for both local and remote branches
- Branch switching with automatic git operations
- Integration with repository activation system
- Branch information including commit details

**Key Components**:
- `ActivatedRepoManager.list_repository_branches()` - Lists available branches
- `ActivatedRepoManager.switch_branch()` - Switches to different branch
- `/api/repos/{alias}/branches` - Branch listing API endpoint

## üîß **Core Requirements**

1. **Branch Listing**: Users can list all available branches in activated repositories
2. **Branch Switching**: Users can switch between existing local and remote branches
3. **Branch Information**: System provides detailed branch information including commit data
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for invalid branch operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **Sync operations work on current branch only** - Multi-branch sync is NOT supported
- Branch switching triggers git operations in the activated repository
- Remote branches can be checked out as new local tracking branches

## üìã **Stories Breakdown**

### Story 9.1: Branch Listing Operations
- **Goal**: Validate branch listing functionality through API
- **Scope**: List local and remote branches with detailed information

### Story 9.2: Branch Switching Operations
