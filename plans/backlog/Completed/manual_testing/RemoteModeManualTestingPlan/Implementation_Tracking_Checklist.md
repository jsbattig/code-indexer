## 🚦 **Implementation Dependencies**

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Connection Setup** → **Authentication Security** → **Repository Management** → **Semantic Search**
2. **Phase 1** must complete before **Phase 2** can begin
3. **Phase 2** can execute in parallel after **Phase 1** completion
4. **Phase 3** requires **Phase 1** and most of **Phase 2** for meaningful results

### Blocking Relationships
- All features depend on **Feature 1** (Connection Setup)
- Repository-based features depend on **Feature 3** (Repository Management)
- Query-based features depend on **Feature 4** (Semantic Search)
- Advanced features depend on core functionality working properly

[Conversation Reference: "Dependencies: Connection setup must complete before other features"]

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### Phase Completion Requirements
- **Phase 1**: 100% story completion required before proceeding
- **Phase 2**: 80% story completion acceptable for Phase 3
- **Phase 3**: Best-effort completion for optimization validation

### Epic Success Requirements
- Core functionality (Phase 1) must achieve 100% completion
- Performance meets specified targets (2x local mode max)
- Security requirements fully validated
- User experience parity with local mode achieved

## 📝 **Testing Notes**

### Manual Execution Requirements
- Each story requires hands-on command execution
- Pass/fail assessment based on clearly defined criteria
- Real server environment for authentic testing
- Documentation of any issues or deviations

### Quality Assurance
- All commands must be executed as specified
- Results must match expected outcomes
- Error scenarios must be tested thoroughly
- Performance measurements must be recorded
