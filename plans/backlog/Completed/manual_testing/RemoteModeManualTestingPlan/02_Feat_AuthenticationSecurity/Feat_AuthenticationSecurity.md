# Feature 2: Authentication Security

## 🎯 **Feature Intent**

Test authentication flows and security features to ensure proper credential management and JWT token lifecycle validation in remote mode operations.

[Conversation Reference: "02_Feat_AuthenticationSecurity: Test authentication flows and security features"]

## 📋 **Feature Summary**

This feature validates the security aspects of CIDX remote mode operation, focusing on authentication flows, credential encryption, token management, and secure communication protocols. Testing ensures that all security requirements are met for production deployment.

## 🔧 **Implementation Stories**

### Story 2.1: Login/Logout Flow Testing
**Priority**: High - fundamental security operation
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Login flow with username/password executes correctly
- JWT tokens are acquired and stored securely
- Logout flow clears authentication state properly

[Conversation Reference: "Login/logout flows, token lifecycle management"]

### Story 2.2: Token Lifecycle Management Validation
**Priority**: High - ensures continuous authenticated operation
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Token refresh mechanism works automatically
- Expired token handling triggers re-authentication
- Token storage and memory management is secure

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Authentication Speed**: Token acquisition completes in <5 seconds
- **Token Security**: Credentials encrypted using PBKDF2 with project-specific keys
- **Automatic Refresh**: JWT tokens refresh before expiration without user intervention
- **Secure Storage**: No plaintext credentials stored or logged

## 🎯 **Story Implementation Checkboxes**
