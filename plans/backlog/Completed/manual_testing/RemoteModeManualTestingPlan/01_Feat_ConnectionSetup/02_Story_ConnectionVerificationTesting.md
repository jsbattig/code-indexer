# Story 1.2: Connection Verification Testing

## üéØ **Story Intent**

Validate connection verification procedures and server health checks to ensure reliable remote server communication.

[Conversation Reference: "Connection verification procedures"]

## üìã **Story Description**

**As a** Developer
**I want to** verify my connection to the remote CIDX server
**So that** I can confirm proper setup and troubleshoot connection issues

## üîß **Test Procedures**

### Test 1.2.1: Connection Status Verification
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli status
```

**Expected Results:**
- Displays current mode as "Remote"
- Shows server URL (with credentials masked)
- Reports connection status as "Connected"
- Shows last successful connection timestamp

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Status shows remote mode with proper connection info
- ‚ùå FAIL: Missing information or incorrect status

### Test 1.2.2: Server Health Check
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli remote health-check
```

**Expected Results:**
- Server responds with health status
- API version compatibility confirmed
- Response time displayed
- Authentication status validated

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Health check passes with all components healthy
- ‚ùå FAIL: Health check fails or shows component issues

### Test 1.2.3: Authentication Token Validation
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli remote validate-token
```

**Expected Results:**
- Current token validated against server
- Token expiration time displayed
- Renewal status shown if applicable
- User permissions confirmed

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Token valid with proper expiration info
- ‚ùå FAIL: Token invalid or missing expiration data

### Test 1.2.4: Network Connectivity Test
**Command to Execute:**
```bash
python -m code_indexer.cli remote test-connection
```

**Expected Results:**
- Network latency measurements displayed
- Connection stability report
- Throughput test results
- DNS resolution confirmation

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PASS: Connection stable with acceptable performance
- ‚ùå FAIL: Connection unstable or poor performance

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Health Check Speed**: Server health verification completes in <5 seconds
- **Connection Reliability**: Consistent connection status across multiple checks
- **Token Validity**: Authentication tokens properly validated and managed
- **Network Performance**: Acceptable latency and throughput for query operations

## üéØ **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Status command shows accurate remote mode information
- [ ] Server health check validates all required components
- [ ] Authentication tokens are properly validated
- [ ] Network connectivity meets performance requirements
- [ ] All verification commands provide clear, actionable output
- [ ] Error conditions are handled gracefully with helpful messages

## üìù **Manual Testing Notes**

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed Story 1.1 (Remote Initialization Testing)
- Active remote configuration in place
- Network connectivity to server
- Valid authentication credentials

**Test Environment Setup:**
1. Ensure remote initialization completed successfully
2. Verify .code-indexer/.remote-config exists
3. Confirm network path to server is clear
4. Have server administrator contact for troubleshooting

**Post-Test Validation:**
1. All verification commands succeed
2. Connection information is accurate and current
3. No authentication errors during testing
4. Network performance meets requirements

**Troubleshooting Guide:**
- Connection failures: Check network path and server status
- Authentication issues: Verify credentials and token validity
- Performance problems: Test network latency and bandwidth
- Health check failures: Contact server administrator
