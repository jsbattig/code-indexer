# User Story: Multi-Project Credential Isolation

## 📋 **User Story**

As a **CIDX user working on multiple projects**, I want **independent credential management per project**, so that **credential compromise in one project doesn't affect others and I can use different servers per project**.

## 🎯 **Business Value**

Provides security isolation and operational flexibility for users managing multiple projects with different remote servers or credentials.

## 📝 **Acceptance Criteria**

### Given: Project-Specific Credential Storage
**When** I configure remote mode for different projects  
**Then** each project stores credentials independently  
**And** credential encryption uses project-specific key derivation  
**And** projects cannot access each other's credential data  
**And** credential compromise limited to single project scope  

### Given: Independent Credential Lifecycles
**When** I manage credentials across projects  
**Then** credential updates in one project don't affect others  
**And** credential expiration handled independently per project  
**And** project removal cleans up only that project's credentials  
**And** different servers and usernames supported per project  

## 📊 **Definition of Done**

- ✅ Project-specific credential encryption with unique key derivation

- ✅ Cross-project credential isolation validation
- ✅ Independent credential lifecycle management
- ✅ Secure cleanup when projects are removed
- ✅ Support for different servers and credentials per project
- ✅ Comprehensive security testing across multiple projects
- ✅ Documentation explains multi-project credential architecture
