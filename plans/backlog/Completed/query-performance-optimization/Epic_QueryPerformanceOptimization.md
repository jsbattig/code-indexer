# Epic: Query Performance Optimization [PARTIALLY COMPLETE]

## Epic Overview

**Status:** ✅ Story 1.1 COMPLETED | ❌ Stories 2.0-2.4 CANCELLED
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-26
**Commit:** 97b8278

**Problem Statement:**
CLI query performance suffers from severe bottlenecks in high-frequency usage scenarios, with 60% of execution time wasted on Python startup overhead and repeated index loading operations. The system requires 3.09s per query, making batch operations prohibitively slow (1000 queries = 51.5 minutes).

**Business Value Achieved:**
- ✅ Reduce query latency by 15-30% (175-265ms savings per query)
- ✅ Enable more efficient batch query operations
- ✅ Improve developer experience with faster semantic search
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility for existing workflows

**Original Success Metrics:**
- ~~Query latency: 3.09s → 1.35s (56% reduction)~~ **Achieved:** 15-30% reduction via parallel execution
- ~~Startup overhead: 1.86s → 50ms (97% reduction)~~ **Cancelled:** Daemon architecture not pursued
- ~~Index loading: Eliminate 376ms repeated I/O via caching~~ **Cancelled:** In-memory caching not pursued
- ~~Concurrent query support: Multiple reads, serialized writes~~ **Cancelled:** Not implemented
- ✅ Zero breaking changes: Full backward compatibility **Achieved**

**Decision:** Daemon architecture (Stories 2.0-2.4) cancelled. Parallel execution provides acceptable performance improvement without architectural complexity.

## Current State Analysis

**Performance Breakdown (Per Query):**
```
Total Time: 3.09s (100%)
├── Startup: 1.86s (60%)
│   ├── Python interpreter: 400ms
│   ├── Rich/argparse imports: 460ms
│   └── Application initialization: 1000ms
├── Index Loading: 376ms (12%)
│   ├── HNSW index: 180ms
│   └── ID mapping index: 196ms
├── Embedding Generation: 792ms (26%)
└── Vector Search: 62ms (2%)
```

**Key Bottlenecks:**
1. **Startup Overhead:** 60% of time on Python/module initialization per query
2. **Repeated I/O:** Index files loaded from disk for every single query
3. **Sequential Blocking:** Embedding waits for index loading unnecessarily
4. **No Concurrency:** Server jobs serialize when could parallelize reads

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Story 1.1)
Parallelize index loading with embedding generation using ThreadPoolExecutor.
- **Immediate Impact:** 467ms saved (40% query time reduction)
- **Implementation:** Minimal changes to filesystem_vector_store.py
- **Risk:** Low - uses existing threading patterns

### Phase 2: Daemon Architecture (Stories 2.0-2.4)
Persistent RPyC daemon service with in-memory index caching.
- **Architecture:** Client/server split with RPyC communication
- **Caching:** Per-project index caching with TTL eviction
- **Concurrency:** Read/write locks per project
- **Compatibility:** Automatic fallback to standalone mode

## Feature Breakdown

### Feature 1: Query Parallelization [HIGH - MVP]
**Objective:** Eliminate sequential blocking between index loading and embedding generation.
- **Scope:** Thread-based parallelization in search pipeline
- **Impact:** 467ms reduction per query (15% total improvement)
- **Complexity:** Low - single file modification

### Feature 2: CIDX Daemonization [HIGH - MVP]
**Objective:** Eliminate startup overhead and repeated index loading via persistent daemon.
- **Scope:** RPyC daemon, client delegation, index caching
- **Impact:** 2.24s reduction per query (73% total improvement)
- **Complexity:** High - new service architecture

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Backward Compatibility Strategy
**Selected:** Option A - Optional daemon with auto-fallback
- Daemon mode configured per repository
- Automatic fallback if daemon unreachable
- Console reporting of daemon status
- **Rationale:** Zero friction adoption, graceful degradation

### Decision 2: Memory Management Strategy
**Selected:** TTL-based eviction without hard limits
- Default 60-minute TTL (configurable per project)
- Background thread monitors idle time
- No memory limits - trust OS memory management
- **Rationale:** Simple, predictable, avoids premature eviction

### Decision 3: Daemon Lifecycle Management
**Selected:** Option B - Automatic daemon startup
- Auto-start on first query if configured
- No manual daemon management required
- PID file tracking for process management
- **Rationale:** Frictionless user experience

### Decision 4: Error Handling Philosophy
**Selected:** Option A - Silent fallback with reporting
- Never fail query due to daemon issues
- Clear console messages on fallback
- Provide actionable troubleshooting tips
- **Rationale:** Reliability over performance

## Technical Integration Points

**Key Files for Modification:**
- `filesystem_vector_store.py:1056-1090` - Parallelization point
- `cli.py:2826` - Client delegation entry point
- `config.json` - Daemon configuration storage
- New: `daemon_service.py` - RPyC service implementation

**Threading Strategy:**
- ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound operations
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Per-project RLock for concurrent reads
- Per-project Lock for serialized writes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Performance PoC (Story 2.0) [BLOCKING]
Validate daemon architecture feasibility before full implementation.

**Measurements Required:**
- Baseline vs daemon query time (cold start)
- Baseline vs daemon query time (warm cache)
- RPyC communication overhead
- Import time savings validation

**GO/NO-GO Criteria:**
- ≥30% overall speedup achieved
- <100ms RPC communication overhead
- Stable daemon operation over 100 queries
- Clean fallback on daemon failure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Stories 1.1, 2.1-2.4)
1. **Story 1.1:** Implement parallel index loading (1 day)
2. **Story 2.1:** Build RPyC daemon service (3 days)
3. **Story 2.2:** Add daemon configuration (1 day)
4. **Story 2.3:** Implement client delegation (2 days)
5. **Story 2.4:** Add progress streaming (1 day)

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for daemon lifecycle
- Performance benchmarks against baseline
- Load testing with concurrent queries
- Fallback scenario validation

## Risk Management

**Technical Risks:**
1. **RPyC Stability:** Mitigated by PoC validation
2. **Memory Growth:** Mitigated by TTL eviction
3. **Daemon Crashes:** Mitigated by auto-restart
4. **Compatibility:** Mitigated by fallback mode

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive PoC before implementation
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Extensive error handling and logging
- Performance regression testing
