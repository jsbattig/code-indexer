# Story 2.1: Git Pull Operations

## Story Description

As a CIDX user with a linked repository, I need the system to pull latest changes from the remote repository during sync operations, so that my local semantic index stays current with the remote codebase.

## Technical Specification

### Git Operation Sequence

```pseudocode
class GitPullOperation:
    def execute(repo_path: string, options: PullOptions):
        1. validateRepository(repo_path)
        2. storeCurrentState()
        3. fetchRemote(options.remote, options.branch)
        4. checkFastForward()
        5. if (fastForward):
              mergeFastForward()
           else:
              performMerge(options.strategy)
        6. updateSubmodules()
        7. recordSyncMetadata()

class PullOptions:
    remote: string = "origin"
    branch: string = "main"
    strategy: MergeStrategy = MERGE_COMMIT
    fetchDepth: int = 0  # 0 = full history
    includeSubmodules: bool = true
```

### Progress Reporting

```pseudocode
GitProgress:
    VALIDATING = "Validating repository..."
    FETCHING = "Fetching remote changes..."
    MERGING = "Merging changes..."
    SUBMODULES = "Updating submodules..."
    COMPLETE = "Git sync complete"

    reportProgress(phase: string, percent: int, details: string)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Repository Validation
```gherkin
Given a sync job is executing git pull
When the operation starts
Then the system should validate:
  - Repository exists at specified path
  - Repository has valid .git directory
  - Remote repository is configured
  - Network connectivity to remote
And validation errors should be clearly reported
```

### Remote Fetch Execution
```gherkin
Given a valid repository with remote changes
When the fetch operation executes
Then the system should:
  - Fetch all branches or specified branch
  - Download new commits and objects
  - Update remote tracking branches
  - Report fetch progress (0-50%)
And the fetch should complete within timeout
```

### Merge/Rebase Operations
```gherkin
Given remote changes have been fetched
When merging with local branch
Then the system should:
  - Attempt fast-forward if possible
  - Create merge commit if needed
  - Preserve local uncommitted changes
  - Report merge progress (50-90%)
And successful merge should update working tree
```

### Progress Tracking
```gherkin
Given a git pull operation is running
When progress updates occur
Then the system should report:
  - Current operation phase
  - Percentage complete (0-100)
  - Specific operation details
  - Transfer speed for network operations
And updates should occur at least every second
```

### Submodule Handling
```gherkin
Given a repository has submodules
When pull operation includes submodules
Then the system should:
  - Recursively update all submodules
  - Handle nested submodules
  - Report submodule progress (90-100%)
  - Skip broken submodules with warning
```

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Repository validation
  - [ ] Check .git directory exists
  - [ ] Verify remote configuration
  - [ ] Test network connectivity
  - [ ] Validate branch existence
- [ ] Remote fetch execution
  - [ ] Execute git fetch command
  - [ ] Handle authentication
  - [ ] Process large repositories
  - [ ] Report transfer progress
- [ ] Merge/rebase operations
  - [ ] Fast-forward when possible
  - [ ] Create merge commits
  - [ ] Handle merge strategies
  - [ ] Update working tree
- [ ] Progress tracking
  - [ ] Phase-based progress
  - [ ] Percentage calculation
  - [ ] Real-time updates
  - [ ] Detailed operation info

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Clean repository → Fast-forward merge → Success
2. Behind remote → Fetch & merge → Updated successfully
3. With submodules → Recursive update → All updated
4. Large repository → Progress shown → Completes in time

### Error Cases
1. No network → Clear error: "Cannot reach remote"
2. Invalid credentials → Auth error with guidance
3. Corrupted repository → Validation fails early
4. Merge conflict → Reported for resolution

### Edge Cases
1. Empty repository → Handle gracefully
2. Shallow clone → Fetch within depth
3. Renamed default branch → Detect and adapt
4. Concurrent modifications → Lock repository

## Performance Requirements

- Repository validation: <1 second
- Fetch small repo (<10MB): <5 seconds
- Fetch large repo (<1GB): <60 seconds
- Merge operation: <2 seconds
- Progress update frequency: 1Hz minimum

## Git Command Examples

```bash
# Validate repository
git rev-parse --git-dir

# Fetch with progress
git fetch --progress origin main

# Check fast-forward
git merge-base HEAD origin/main

# Perform merge
git merge origin/main --no-edit

# Update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Error Messages

| Condition | User Message |
|-----------|--------------|
| No .git | "Not a git repository. Please link a valid repository." |
| No remote | "No remote configured. Please set up remote repository." |
| Network error | "Cannot connect to remote. Check network and try again." |
| Auth failure | "Authentication failed. Please check credentials." |
| Merge conflict | "Merge conflicts detected. Manual resolution required." |
