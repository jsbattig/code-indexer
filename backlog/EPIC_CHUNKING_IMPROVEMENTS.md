# Epic: Convert Regex-Based Language Parsers to AST-Based Parsing [COMPLETED]

## Epic Overview
**As a** developer using code-indexer  
**I want** all language parsers to use proper AST-based parsing instead of regex  
**So that** chunking produces accurate boundaries, prevents data loss, and ensures semantic integrity across all supported programming languages

## 🎉 Epic Status: COMPLETED ✅

**Discovery**: Upon analysis, it was found that proper AST-based parsers already existed as *_parser_new.py files but were not activated in the system.

**Solution**: Instead of rewriting parsers from scratch, the existing high-quality AST-based implementations were activated by:
1. Removing the old regex-based parser files
2. Renaming the *_parser_new.py files to replace the old ones
3. Fixing circular import issues in fallback methods
4. Testing and validating the new parsers work correctly

## Final State Analysis
After remediation, **all language parsers now use proper AST-based parsing**:

### ✅ **All Parsers Properly Implemented (22 parsers)**
All parsers now use **BaseTreeSitterParser** with proper AST parsing:
- **Java Parser** ✅ - **FIXED**: Now uses tree-sitter AST parsing, data loss eliminated
- **JavaScript Parser** ✅ - **FIXED**: Now uses tree-sitter AST parsing with proper ES6+ support
- **Go Parser** ✅ - **FIXED**: Now uses tree-sitter AST parsing with package/interface support
- **Kotlin Parser** ✅ - **FIXED**: Now uses tree-sitter AST parsing with coroutines/extensions
- **TypeScript Parser** ✅ - **FIXED**: Now uses tree-sitter AST parsing with full type support
- C, C++, C#, Rust, Swift, Ruby, Lua, HTML, CSS, SQL, XML, YAML, Groovy, Python, Pascal

## Business Impact Resolved
- ✅ **Data Loss Eliminated**: All parsers now use AST-based parsing with no character loss
- ✅ **Improved Search Quality**: Proper semantic boundaries enhance chunking quality
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: All parsers follow BaseTreeSitterParser architecture
- ✅ **Reduced Maintenance**: No more regex pattern updates needed

## Test Results Validation
The new AST-based parsers have been tested and validated:

## Story 1: Convert Java Parser from Regex to AST-Based Parsing [✅ COMPLETED]

**As a** developer indexing Java projects  
**I want** Java files parsed using tree-sitter AST instead of regex  
**So that** I get accurate semantic boundaries without data loss

### Problem Statement
The Java parser (`java_parser.py`) uses pure regex parsing with confirmed data loss:
```python
# Current problematic approach
class JavaSemanticParser(BaseSemanticParser):  # ❌ Wrong base class
    def _find_constructs(self, content, lines, file_path):
        # Uses regex patterns for classes, methods, fields
```

### Acceptance Criteria

#### **AC1: Proper AST Infrastructure**
```gherkin
Given a Java file with complex nested structures
When the parser processes the file  
Then it should use BaseTreeSitterParser inheritance
And it should use tree-sitter Java grammar for AST parsing
And it should NOT use regex for primary parsing logic
```

#### **AC2: No Data Loss**
```gherkin
Given a Java file with 1000 lines of complex code
When parsed by both old regex and new AST parser
Then every character of source code should be included in chunks
And no whitespace, comments, or code should be lost
And chunk boundaries should align with semantic units
```

#### **AC3: Accurate Semantic Boundaries**
```gherkin
Given Java code with nested classes, inner classes, and methods
When the AST parser processes the code
Then each class should be a separate chunk with proper boundaries
And inner classes should maintain parent-child relationships
And method boundaries should not fragment across chunks
And comments should be included with their associated constructs
```

#### **AC4: Handle Complex Java Constructs**
```gherkin
Given Java code with generics, annotations, lambdas, and interfaces
When processed by the AST parser
Then generic type parameters should be preserved in signatures
And annotations should be associated with their targets
And lambda expressions should maintain proper context
And interface implementations should show relationships
```

#### **AC5: Performance and Memory**
```gherkin
Given large Java files (>10,000 lines)
When processed by the AST parser
Then parsing should complete within 2 seconds per file
And memory usage should not exceed 50MB per file
And the parser should handle syntax errors gracefully
```

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Convert from `BaseSemanticParser` to `BaseTreeSitterParser`
- Use `tree_sitter_language_pack.get_parser("java")`  
- Implement `_extract_constructs()` method following Pascal parser pattern
- Add comprehensive error node handling for malformed Java

**I want** JavaScript files parsed using tree-sitter AST instead of regex  
**So that** modern JS features are properly handled with accurate boundaries

### Problem Statement
JavaScript parser uses regex patterns that fail on:
- ES6+ arrow functions and destructuring
- Complex object/class syntax
- Template literals and embedded expressions
- Async/await patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

#### **AC1: Modern JavaScript Support**
```gherkin
Given JavaScript code with ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals)
When processed by the AST parser
Then all modern syntax should be properly parsed
And arrow functions should be identified as function constructs
And template literals should preserve embedded expressions
And destructuring assignments should maintain context
```

#### **AC2: Framework-Specific Handling**
```gherkin
Given React/Vue/Angular component files
When processed by the AST parser
Then component definitions should be separate chunks
And JSX/template syntax should be preserved
And lifecycle methods should maintain proper boundaries
And props/state should be associated with components
```

#### **AC3: No Data Loss in Complex Expressions**
```gherkin
Given JavaScript with nested callbacks, closures, and IIFE patterns
When parsed by the AST parser
Then all nested structures should be properly captured
And closure contexts should be maintained
And IIFE patterns should be preserved as complete units
And callback hierarchies should maintain relationships
```

## Story 3: Convert Python Parser from Regex to AST-Based Parsing [✅ COMPLETED]

**As a** developer indexing Python projects  
**I want** Python files parsed using tree-sitter AST instead of regex  
**So that** Python's indentation-based structure is properly handled

### Problem Statement
Python's indentation-sensitive syntax makes regex parsing particularly unreliable:
- Nested class/function definitions
- Decorators and their targets
- Complex comprehensions and generators
- Multi-line statements and expressions

### Acceptance Criteria

#### **AC1: Indentation-Aware Parsing**
```gherkin
Given Python code with complex indentation levels
When processed by the AST parser
Then indentation should determine proper construct boundaries
And nested functions should maintain parent-child relationships
And class methods should be properly associated with classes
And global vs local scope should be accurately identified
```

#### **AC2: Decorator Association**
```gherkin
Given Python code with multiple decorators on functions/classes
When processed by the AST parser
Then decorators should be included with their target constructs
And decorator chains should be preserved in order
And parameterized decorators should maintain arguments
And decorator metadata should be accessible in semantic context
```

#### **AC3: Advanced Python Features**
```gherkin
Given Python code with comprehensions, generators, and context managers
When processed by the AST parser
Then list/dict/set comprehensions should be complete units
And generator expressions should preserve yield semantics
And with statements should maintain context manager relationships
And async/await patterns should be properly handled
```

**As a** developer indexing Go projects  
**I want** Go files parsed using tree-sitter AST instead of regex  
**So that** Go's package system and interface patterns are accurately captured

### Acceptance Criteria

#### **AC1: Package and Import Structure**
```gherkin
Given Go code with complex package and import statements
When processed by the AST parser
Then package declarations should be preserved with full context
And import groups should maintain organization
And type definitions should show package relationships
And exported vs unexported symbols should be identified
```

#### **AC2: Interface and Struct Relationships**
```gherkin
Given Go code with interfaces, structs, and method sets
When processed by the AST parser
Then interface definitions should be complete chunks
And struct definitions should include embedded fields
And method receivers should be associated with types
And interface implementations should be identifiable
```

**As a** developer indexing Kotlin projects  
**I want** Kotlin files parsed using tree-sitter AST instead of regex  
**So that** Kotlin's advanced language features are properly handled

### Acceptance Criteria

#### **AC1: Advanced Kotlin Features**
```gherkin
Given Kotlin code with data classes, sealed classes, and extensions
When processed by the AST parser
Then data class properties should be auto-generated and captured
And sealed class hierarchies should show relationships
And extension functions should maintain target type context
And companion objects should be associated with classes
```

#### **AC2: Coroutines and Lambda Support**
```gherkin
Given Kotlin code with coroutines and complex lambda expressions
When processed by the AST parser
Then suspend functions should be identified with metadata
And coroutine scopes should be preserved
And trailing lambda syntax should be properly parsed
And receiver lambda contexts should be maintained
```

## Story 6: Fix Pascal Parser Architectural Inconsistency [✅ COMPLETED]

**As a** developer maintaining consistent parser architecture  
**I want** Pascal parser to inherit from BaseTreeSitterParser  
**So that** all AST-based parsers use the same architectural pattern

### Problem Statement
Pascal parser already uses proper tree-sitter parsing internally but inherits from `BaseSemanticParser` instead of `BaseTreeSitterParser`, breaking architectural consistency.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### **AC1: Correct Inheritance**
```gherkin
Given the Pascal parser implementation
When refactored for consistency
Then it should inherit from BaseTreeSitterParser
And it should use the standard AST parsing workflow
And existing Pascal parsing functionality should be preserved
And parser behavior should remain identical for end users
```

#### **AC2: Remove Code Duplication**
```gherkin
Given the Pascal parser after refactoring
When compared to other BaseTreeSitterParser implementations
Then common AST parsing logic should be inherited, not duplicated
And Pascal-specific logic should be in override methods only
And error handling should follow the standard pattern
```
