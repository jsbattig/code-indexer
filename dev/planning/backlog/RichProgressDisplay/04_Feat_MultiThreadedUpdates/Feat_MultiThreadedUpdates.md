# Feature 4: Multi-Threaded Updates

## Feature Overview

Implement real-time concurrent updates for multi-threaded file processing with proper ramping down behavior, showing 8 threads processing initially and gradually reducing to 0 threads at completion.

## Technical Architecture

### Component Design
- **Thread-Safe Display Updates**: Concurrent file status updates from worker threads
- **Ramping Down Logic**: Gradual reduction from 8 active lines to 0 lines
- **Completion Sequencing**: Proper end-of-process behavior
- **State Synchronization**: Thread-safe coordination between workers and display

### Threading Behavior
```
Start: 8 threads → 8 file lines displayed
Mid:   4 threads → 4 file lines displayed  
End:   1 thread  → 1 file line displayed
Final: 0 threads → 0 file lines, progress bar at 100%
```

### Update Frequency
- **Refresh Rate**: 10 FPS for smooth real-time updates
- **Status Changes**: Immediate updates on file start/complete
- **Timer Updates**: 1-second granularity for elapsed time

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - 01_Feat_BottomAnchoredDisplay (Rich Live foundation)
  - 02_Feat_AggregateProgressLine (aggregate metrics)
  - 03_Feat_IndividualFileTracking (file line management)
- **Dependent Features**: None (final feature)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 8 worker threads show 8 individual file lines maximum
- [ ] Active thread count matches number of displayed file lines
- [ ] Files start with "vectorizing..." immediately when processing begins
- [ ] Files show "complete" for exactly 3 seconds after processing
- [ ] Lines disappear after completion display period
- [ ] Ramping down: file lines reduce as threads finish work
- [ ] Final state: 0 file lines, progress bar at 100%
- [ ] Thread-safe updates prevent display corruption
- [ ] Real-time responsiveness (10 FPS update rate)
