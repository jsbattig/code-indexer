# Story 3: Completion Behavior

## User Story

**As a developer monitoring file processing completion**, I want completed files to show a "complete" status for exactly 3 seconds before disappearing from the display, so that I can see confirmation of successful processing while keeping the display clean as threads finish their work.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given a worker thread completes processing a file
### When the file processing finishes successfully  
### Then the file line should immediately show "complete" status
### And the file line should remain visible for exactly 3 seconds
### And after 3 seconds the file line should disappear from the display
### And the display should automatically adjust to remove the completed file line
### And other active file lines should remain unaffected

### Given multiple files complete within the 3-second window
### When several files finish processing simultaneously
### Then each file should maintain its own independent 3-second timer
### And files should disappear individually based on their completion time
### And the display should handle multiple concurrent completion timers

## Technical Requirements

### Pseudocode Implementation
```
CompletionBehaviorManager:
    COMPLETION_DISPLAY_DURATION = 3.0  # seconds
    
    handle_file_completion(file_id, completion_time):
        update_file_status(file_id, "complete")
        schedule_removal(file_id, completion_time + COMPLETION_DISPLAY_DURATION)
        trigger_display_update()
    
    schedule_removal(file_id, removal_time):
        add_to_removal_queue(file_id, removal_time)
        start_timer_if_needed()
    
    check_removal_queue():
        current_time = get_current_time()
        for file_id, removal_time in removal_queue:
            if current_time >= removal_time:
                remove_file_line(file_id)
                trigger_display_update()
    
    remove_file_line(file_id):
        delete_from_active_files(file_id)
        update_display_to_reflect_removal()
```

### Timeline Behavior
```
T=0s:  ├─ utils.py (2.1 KB, 5s) vectorizing...
T=5s:  ├─ utils.py (2.1 KB, 5s) complete      ← File completes
T=6s:  ├─ utils.py (2.1 KB, 5s) complete      ← Still showing
T=7s:  ├─ utils.py (2.1 KB, 5s) complete      ← Still showing  
T=8s:  [line disappears]                       ← 3 seconds elapsed
```

## Definition of Done

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist:
- [ ] Completed files immediately show "complete" status
- [ ] File lines remain visible for exactly 3 seconds after completion
- [ ] File lines automatically disappear after 3-second timer
- [ ] Display adjusts automatically to remove completed file lines
- [ ] Other active file lines remain unaffected by completions
- [ ] Multiple concurrent completion timers handled correctly
- [ ] Files disappear individually based on their completion time
- [ ] Timer accuracy maintained across concurrent completions

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Required:
- 3-second timer accuracy for completion display
- File line removal after timer expiration
- Multiple concurrent completion timer handling
- Display update triggering on completion and removal

### Integration Tests Required:
- End-to-end completion behavior with real file processing
- Concurrent completion scenarios with multiple files
- Timer accuracy under multi-threaded processing load
